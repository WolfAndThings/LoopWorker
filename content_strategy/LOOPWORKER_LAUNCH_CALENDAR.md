# LOOPWORKER LAUNCH CALENDAR
## 0-Follower Cold Start Strategy

---

## THE COLD START PROBLEM

**Why this calendar is different from the 60-day calendar:**

At 0 followers, you have NO social proof. Aggressive hooks like "Your prompts suck" can backfire because:
- No credibility = viewers think "who is this guy?"
- Attack hooks need authority to land
- CTAs at 0 followers = desperate vibes

**The solution:** Build credibility FIRST, then go aggressive.

---

## PHASE BREAKDOWN

| Phase | Days | Followers Target | Strategy |
|-------|------|------------------|----------|
| **1: PROOF** | 1-14 | 0 → 500 | Pure value, no CTAs, show insane output |
| **2: AUTHORITY** | 15-28 | 500 → 2K | Soft hooks, light CTAs, opinion content |
| **3: ATTACK** | 29-60 | 2K+ | Full aggressive mode, all CTAs live |

---

# PHASE 1: PROOF MODE (Days 1-14)
## Goal: Show you're legit before asking for anything

**Rules:**
- ❌ NO comment-trigger CTAs
- ❌ NO "Your X sucks" attacks
- ✅ Pure value, insane output
- ✅ End with "Follow for more" only
- ✅ 2 posts per day (morning + evening)

### DAY 1 (Launch Day)

**POST 1: The Portfolio Drop**
```
HOOK: "I built 5 fake brands in 5 days using only AI. Here's all of them."

VISUAL: Fast montage of all 5 brands - logos, products, ads, packaging

SCRIPT:
"I built 5 fake brands in 5 days using only AI.

Day 1: A luxury skincare line. Logo, packaging, model shots - all Midjourney.

Day 2: A coffee brand. I gave it a Japanese aesthetic, muted tones, ceramic vibes.

Day 3: A burger chain. Neon, grease, 90s nostalgia.

Day 4: A streetwear drop. Oversized fits, brutalist typography.

Day 5: A perfume house. Art deco meets modernism.

5 brands. 5 days. Zero photographers. Zero designers.

Just prompts.

Follow if you want to learn how."

DURATION: 55 seconds

VISUAL: Cinematic AI-generated perfume commercial

SCRIPT:
"This perfume ad cost $0 to make.

No photographer. No model. No studio. No retoucher.

I typed 47 words into Midjourney and got this.

The bottle? Generated.
The hands? Generated.
The lighting? Generated.
The reflection in the glass? Generated.

This is what advertising looks like now.

And most agencies haven't figured it out yet."

DURATION: 45 seconds
CTA: Follow for more

### DAY 2

**POST 1: Tool Reveal (Educational)**
```
HOOK: "The free tool that's replacing $10K photoshoots."

VISUAL: Split screen - traditional photoshoot BTS vs. you typing prompts

SCRIPT:
"The free tool that's replacing $10K photoshoots.

It's called Flux. And it just went open source.

Traditional photoshoot:
- Photographer: $2,000
- Studio: $500
- Model: $1,500
- Retouching: $800
- Props: $400
- Total: $5,200 minimum

Flux:
- Computer you already own
- Prompts you write in 30 seconds
- Results in 2 minutes
- Cost: $0

Same output. Fraction of the time. Zero of the cost.

This is the shift."

**POST 2: Brand Build Timelapse**
```
HOOK: "Watch me build a coffee brand in 90 seconds."

SCRIPT:
"Watch me build a coffee brand in 90 seconds.

First, the concept: Japanese minimalism meets specialty coffee.

Logo - clean, geometric, one color.

Packaging - kraft paper, simple typography, wax seal detail.

Product shots - ceramic cups, steam rising, natural light.

Lifestyle - hands holding cups, morning rituals, quiet moments.

Ad campaign - single image, no text, just mood.

Total time: 47 minutes.
Total cost: $0.
Total team: Just me.

This is how you build brands now."

### DAY 3

**POST 1: The "Secret" Formula**
```
HOOK: "The prompt structure behind every viral AI image."

VISUAL: Text overlay showing prompt breakdown

SCRIPT:
"The prompt structure behind every viral AI image.

It's not random. There's a formula.

Part 1: Subject
What is it? Be specific. Not 'a woman' - 'a 25-year-old woman with silver hair.'

Part 2: Style
What does it look like? 'Editorial photography, soft shadows, 35mm film grain.'

Part 3: Mood
How does it feel? 'Melancholic, intimate, quiet luxury.'

Part 4: Technical
Camera details. 'Shot on Hasselblad, f/1.4, golden hour lighting.'

Subject. Style. Mood. Technical.

That's it. That's the formula.

Stop guessing. Start structuring."

DURATION: 52 seconds
CTA: Follow for more
```

**POST 2: Before/After**
```
HOOK: "Same prompt. Different structure. Completely different result."

VISUAL: Side by side comparison

SCRIPT:
"Same prompt. Different structure. Completely different result.

Prompt 1: 'A woman in a red dress.'
Result: Generic, stock photo vibes, boring.

Prompt 2: 'A 28-year-old woman with auburn hair, wearing a crimson silk slip dress, standing in an abandoned greenhouse, late afternoon light streaming through broken glass, shot on medium format film, melancholic mood, editorial photography.'
Result: This.

The difference isn't the AI. It's the input.

Garbage in, garbage out.
Structure in, art out."

### DAY 4

**POST 1: Industry Commentary (Soft)**
```
HOOK: "Every agency will have an AI team by 2026. Most won't survive without one."

VISUAL: B-roll of agency work + AI generations

SCRIPT:
"Every agency will have an AI team by 2026. Most won't survive without one.

Here's why:

Client wants 50 ad variations. Old way: 3 weeks, $40K.
AI way: 3 days, $400.

Client wants to test 10 different aesthetics. Old way: Pick 2, hope for the best.
AI way: Generate all 10 in an afternoon.

Client changes their mind last minute. Old way: Reshoot, delay, over budget.
AI way: Regenerate, same day, same cost.

The agencies that figure this out will eat the ones that don't.

And they're figuring it out fast."

DURATION: 55 seconds
CTA: Follow for more
```

**POST 2: Tutorial Drop**
```
HOOK: "How I get consistent faces across 100 AI images."

VISUAL: Grid of same "model" in different settings

SCRIPT:
"How I get consistent faces across 100 AI images.

The problem: Every generation gives you a different face.
The solution: Reference images + seed locking.

Step 1: Generate your 'model' - one perfect face shot.

Step 2: Use that as a reference image for all future generations.

Step 3: Lock your seed number so variations stay consistent.

Step 4: Describe poses and settings, not facial features.

Same face. Different shots. Infinite content.

This is how you build a fake influencer, a fake model, a fake brand ambassador.

Consistency is the difference between AI slop and AI art."

### DAY 5

**POST 1: The Impossible Shot**
```
HOOK: "This photo is impossible to take in real life."

VISUAL: Surreal AI image that couldn't exist

SCRIPT:
"This photo is impossible to take in real life.

A woman floating in a room filled with water, wearing a dress made of light, photographed from below as if the camera was underwater but she's above the surface.

No studio could build this set.
No photographer could capture this moment.
No model could hold this pose.
No Photoshop artist could composite this convincingly.

But I made it in 3 minutes.

This isn't about replacing photography. It's about creating things photography can't.

The impossible is now possible. That's the real shift."

DURATION: 48 seconds
CTA: Follow for more
```

**POST 2: Brand Reveal**
```
HOOK: "I built a fake hotel brand. The internet thinks it's real."

VISUAL: Full hotel brand - rooms, lobby, amenities, website mockup

SCRIPT:
"I built a fake hotel brand. The internet thinks it's real.

It's called Mono House. A minimalist boutique hotel.

I generated:
- 20 room shots
- Lobby and common areas
- Restaurant and bar
- Exterior architecture
- Brand collateral
- Website mockups

Posted them. People asked for the booking link.

There is no booking link. There is no hotel.

It's all AI.

But the emotional response was real. The desire was real.

That's the power of good visual branding. It creates want.

Even for things that don't exist."

### DAY 6

**POST 1: The Comparison**
```
HOOK: "Left: $15,000. Right: $0."

VISUAL: Real brand shoot vs AI recreation

SCRIPT:
"Left: $15,000 production budget. Right: $0.

Left: 3 week timeline. Right: 45 minutes.

Left: Team of 12. Right: Just me.

Left: Limited to what exists. Right: Limited only by imagination.

I'm not saying AI is better than traditional photography.

I'm saying for 80% of use cases, it's good enough.

And 'good enough' at $0 beats 'perfect' at $15,000 for most brands.

The math has changed. The game has changed.

Have you?"

VISUAL: Fast montage of 30+ premium AI images

SCRIPT:

None of them look like it.

Editorial fashion.
Luxury products.
Architectural photography.
Food styling.
Portrait work.
Landscape.
Abstract.

All AI. All in the last 30 days.

The trick isn't hiding that it's AI.

The trick is being so good that nobody asks.

Quality removes doubt.
Consistency builds trust.
Volume proves mastery.

Stop apologizing for using AI. Start being excellent at it."

VISUAL: Compilation of all week's content

SCRIPT:

5 complete fake brands.
47 product shots.
12 ad campaigns.
8 lifestyle series.
Countless variations.

Total cost: $0
Total team: 1 person
Total time: Maybe 30 hours across the week.

This used to be impossible. Then it became expensive. Now it's free.

Next week I'm going deeper. More complex brands. More sophisticated workflows.

Follow along if you're building too."

### DAYS 8-14: Continue the Pattern

**Content Types to Rotate:**
1. Brand Reveal (Mon/Thu)
2. Tutorial/Workflow (Tue/Fri)
3. Comparison/Proof (Wed)
4. Gallery/Compilation (Sat)
5. Commentary/Industry (Sun)

**Key Principles:**
- Show insane output quality
- Educate without gatekeeping
- Build credibility through volume
- No CTAs except "follow for more"
- 2 posts per day

---

# PHASE 2: AUTHORITY MODE (Days 15-28)
## Goal: Establish voice, introduce soft CTAs

**Rules:**
- ✅ Soft CTAs ("Save this", "Share with a friend")
- ✅ Opinion content (but not attacks)
- ✅ Start building email list / Discord
- ❌ Still no aggressive hooks
- ✅ 2 posts per day

---

### DAY 15: Transition Day

**POST 1: The Opinion**
```
HOOK: "Unpopular opinion: Most AI art is lazy."

VISUAL: Split screen - lazy AI vs. refined AI

SCRIPT:
"Unpopular opinion: Most AI art is lazy.

Default settings. Zero post-production. Generic prompts.
The AI equivalent of using Comic Sans.

The tools are powerful. The users are not.

Here's the difference:

Lazy: 'A beautiful woman in a red dress.'
Not lazy: 47-word prompt with lighting specs, mood references, camera details, and 3 rounds of refinement.

Lazy: Accept the first generation.
Not lazy: Generate 50 variations, combine the best elements, upscale, color grade, finalize.

The AI is never the bottleneck.
You are.

Stop blaming the tools. Start raising your standards."

DURATION: 52 seconds
CTA: Save this if you agree.
```

**POST 2: Resource Drop**
```
HOOK: "The prompt library I wish I had when I started."

VISUAL: Notion/doc screenshots

SCRIPT:
"The prompt library I wish I had when I started.

100+ tested prompt templates for:
- Product photography
- Editorial fashion
- Architecture
- Food styling
- Lifestyle content

Each one broken down:
- The full prompt
- Why each element works
- Common variations
- Example outputs

I'm building this in public.

Drop a comment if you want early access when it's done."

DURATION: 45 seconds
CTA: Comment for access (soft CTA, no trigger word yet)
```

### DAYS 16-28: Escalation Pattern

**Week 3 Focus:** Opinion content + soft CTAs
- "Here's what most people get wrong about..."
- "The mistake I see everyone making..."
- "Why X isn't working for you..."

**Week 4 Focus:** Community building
- "Working on something big..."
- "Early access for followers..."
- "DM me if you want in..."

---

# PHASE 3: ATTACK MODE (Days 29-60)
## Goal: Full aggressive strategy, all CTAs live

**Rules:**
- ✅ "Your X sucks" hooks
- ✅ Comment-trigger CTAs (SKIN, CAFE, BURGER, etc.)

- ✅ Full script templates from 60-day calendar
- ✅ ManyChat automation live

---

### DAY 29: The Shift

**POST 1: Attack Hook Debut**
```
HOOK: "Your AI images suck. And I know exactly why."

VISUAL: Bad AI vs. Good AI comparison

SCRIPT:
"Your AI images suck. And I know exactly why.

You're using default settings.
You're accepting the first generation.
You're writing prompts like search queries instead of creative briefs.
You're not upscaling.
You're not post-processing.
You're not iterating.

I've spent the last month building brands that fool people.
Real comments asking 'where can I buy this?'
Real DMs asking 'what agency made this?'

None of it was expensive.
All of it was intentional.

I wrote the exact prompt templates I use for everything.

Comment LEVEL and I'll send them to you."

DURATION: 55 seconds
CTA: Comment LEVEL
```

**From here, use the full 60-day calendar scripts with all CTAs active.**
