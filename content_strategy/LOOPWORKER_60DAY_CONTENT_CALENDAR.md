# WEEK 1: ATTACK THE OLD WAY

---

## DAY 1: "Your Brand Photos Suck"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "BRAND"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your brand photos suck.
That's why your Instagram still looks like a 2019 Canva template.

[3-10s] PROBLEM
You're still paying photographers $500 a shoot.
You're still waiting 2 weeks for edits.
You're still getting 10 photos that all look the same.

[10-20s] PIVOT
Meanwhile, I built an entire skincare brand yesterday.
Product shots. Lifestyle images. Model photography.
Zero photographers. Zero budget. One afternoon.

[20-45s] DEMONSTRATION
Here's exactly how:
Step 1: I wrote one master prompt in ChatGPT for my brand's visual identity.
Step 2: I fed it into Midjourney with these exact parameters. [show settings]
Step 3: I upscaled in Magnific and color-graded in Lightroom.

[45-50s] RESULT
60 brand-ready images. Cohesive aesthetic.
Looks like I hired an agency.

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "BRAND" below and I'll DM you my exact prompt template.
```

## DAY 2: "Graphic Designers Are Panicking"
**Hook Type:** Death Announcement
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "PANIC"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
It's officially over for graphic designers.
Not because AI is better—because AI is faster.

[3-12s] CONTEXT
I used to spend $2,000 on a brand identity.
Logo. Colors. Typography. Mood boards.
3 weeks of back-and-forth revisions.

[12-20s] REVEAL
Yesterday I built a complete brand identity in 47 minutes.
A luxury coffee brand that looks like it costs $50,000.

[20-42s] DEMONSTRATION
Here's the workflow:
First, I prompted ChatGPT for brand strategy—name, values, target audience.
Then I generated the logo variations in Ideogram.
Packaging mockups in Midjourney.
And I stitched it all together in Figma.

[42-48s] RESULT
From zero to launch-ready.
Same quality. Fraction of the time.

[48-52s] CTA
Comment "PANIC" and I'll send you the full workflow breakdown.
```

---

## DAY 3: "Your Prompts Are Lazy"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "LAZY"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your prompts are lazy.
That's why all your AI images look like everyone else's.

[3-10s] PROBLEM
You're typing "beautiful woman in coffee shop, cinematic lighting."
And wondering why it looks like stock photography from 2015.

[10-18s] THE REAL ISSUE
The problem isn't the AI.
The problem is you're prompting like a tourist, not a director.

[18-40s] SOLUTION
Here's what separates amateur prompts from professional ones:

Amateurs describe WHAT they want.
Pros describe HOW it should FEEL.

Instead of "woman in coffee shop"—
Try: "Intimate medium shot, morning light bleeding through cafe blinds,
steam rising from ceramic cup, Kodak Portra 400 grain,
directed by Sofia Coppola, melancholic nostalgia."

[40-50s] RESULT
Same subject. Completely different output.
One looks like AI. One looks like art direction.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "LAZY" and I'll DM you my prompt architecture template.
```

---

## DAY 4: "This Burger Brand Isn't Real"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "BURGER"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This burger brand has 47 five-star reviews.
2,000 followers. Professional photography.
It doesn't exist.

[3-10s] CONTEXT
I built it in one night to prove a point:
You don't need a product to build a brand anymore.

[10-18s] WHY THIS MATTERS
In 2026, brand perception IS the product.
The aesthetic. The story. The vibe.
That's what people buy first.

[18-42s] THE BUILD
I started with a brand story in ChatGPT—local burger joint,
smash-style, secret sauce, warehouse district.

Then I generated:
- Hero product shots in Midjourney
- Lifestyle content with Flux
- Menu design in Canva
- Mock Instagram feed

[42-48s] RESULT
Took 4 hours. Looks like a 2-year-old business.
People in my DMs asking when we open.

[48-55s] CTA
Want the full brand kit? Comment "BURGER" and I'll send it over.
```

---

## DAY 5: "Why Are You Still Paying for Stock Photos?"
**Hook Type:** Question
**Duration:** 47s
**CTA Trigger:** "STOCK"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Why are you still paying for stock photos?
Seriously. It's 2026.

[3-10s] PROBLEM
$29/month for images that 10,000 other brands are using.
The same fake handshake. The same laughing salad lady.
Your brand looks like everyone else's because it literally IS everyone else's.

[10-18s] PIVOT
I haven't paid for a stock photo in 8 months.
Every image on my feed? Generated. Custom. Mine.

[18-38s] HOW
Here's my exact workflow:
I keep a prompt library organized by category—lifestyle, product, portrait.
When I need an image, I grab the base prompt,
adjust for my brand's color palette and style,
and generate 20 variations in 5 minutes.

[38-45s] RESULT
Unlimited custom imagery. Zero licensing fees.
Images that actually match my brand instead of
"close enough."

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "STOCK" and I'll send you my prompt library template.
```

---

## DAY 6: "If It Looks Real, Does It Matter That It's Fake?"
**Hook Type:** Philosophical
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "REAL"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
If it looks real, does it matter that it's fake?

[4-12s] CONTEXT
I showed this skincare brand to 50 people.
Asked them to rate the photography.
Average score: 8.7 out of 10.
Then I told them it was AI-generated.

[12-20s] REACTION
Half of them changed their score.
Not because the quality changed—
Because their perception changed.

[20-35s] THE POINT
We're in a weird middle ground right now.
AI imagery is indistinguishable from real photography.
But people still feel "tricked" when they find out.

[35-48s] MY TAKE
Here's what I think:
If the product is real and delivers value,
the marketing images are just... marketing.
We've been retouching and staging photos for 50 years.
AI is just the next tool.

[48-55s] QUESTION
What do you think? Does authenticity matter if the output is identical?

[55-60s] CTA
Comment "REAL" and I'll send you the prompts I used.
```

---

## DAY 7: "Rest In Peace, Traditional Product Photography"
**Hook Type:** Death Announcement
**Duration:** 54s
**CTA Trigger:** "RIP"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Rest in peace, traditional product photography.
2024-2026. It had a good run.

[3-12s] THE SHIFT
Last week I watched a brand spend $15,000 on a product shoot.
Studio rental. Photographer. Stylist. Retoucher.
3 days of work for 40 final images.

[12-20s] COMPARISON
Yesterday I generated 200 product shots for a coffee brand.
Same quality. Different angles. Multiple settings.
Cost: My monthly Midjourney subscription.

[20-40s] WHY THIS MATTERS
It's not about replacing photographers—it's about speed.
When you can test 50 visual concepts before breakfast,
you find what works before spending real money.

Traditional shoots are still valuable for hero content.
But for iteration? For testing? For volume?
AI wins. Every time.

[40-50s] RESULT
I'm not saying fire your photographer.
I'm saying maybe don't book them until you know exactly what you want.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "RIP" and I'll show you my pre-shoot AI testing workflow.
```

# WEEK 2: BUILD THE IMPOSSIBLE

---

## DAY 8: "I Built a $10M Skincare Brand (It's Fake)"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "SKIN"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This skincare brand looks like it raised $10 million.
Premium packaging. Celebrity-style campaign.
It's completely fake.

[3-12s] CONTEXT
I built it to reverse-engineer what makes
luxury brands FEEL luxurious.
Turns out, it's not the product—it's the presentation.

[12-20s] THE COMPONENTS
Every premium brand has the same elements:
- Consistent color story
- Deliberate negative space
- Editorial-quality imagery
- Typography that whispers, not shouts

[20-45s] THE BUILD
Here's how I assembled it:

Brand Identity: ChatGPT for naming, positioning, voice.
I went with "Vessel"—minimal, clinical, premium.

Product Shots: Midjourney with --style raw,
soft shadows, marble surfaces, single hero product.

Campaign Images: Flux for the model work,
Magnific for upscaling, Lightroom for color grading.

[45-55s] RESULT
Full brand launch kit.
Deck-ready for investors.
Could fool anyone in the beauty industry.

[55-62s] CTA
Comment "SKIN" below and I'll DM you the complete prompt suite.
```

---

## DAY 9: "Your Coffee Brand Looks Cheap"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "COFFEE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your coffee brand looks cheap.
Not because of your product—because of your photos.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
Brown beans on brown wood with brown lighting.
Congrats, you look like every other coffee brand on Instagram.
Scroll-worthy? Absolutely not.

[10-18s] WHY IT'S HAPPENING
You're copying what you've seen.
But what you've seen is already saturated.
The aesthetic is dead. The vibe is over.

[18-38s] THE FIX
Premium coffee brands in 2026 don't look "cozy."
They look architectural. Editorial. Unexpected.

Here's my framework:
- Ditch the wood backgrounds. Go concrete. Go marble. Go bold color.
- Stop showing bags. Show the ritual.
- Lighting should be dramatic, not warm.

[38-48s] EXAMPLE
I rebuilt a generic coffee brand with this approach.
Same product. Completely different perception.
Suddenly it's $45 a bag instead of $15.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "COFFEE" and I'll send you the exact prompts.
```

---

## DAY 10: "This Cafe Has a 3-Month Waitlist (It's AI)"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "CAFE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This cafe has a 3-month waitlist.
Interior design blogs are begging to feature it.
It's completely AI-generated.

[3-12s] CONTEXT
I built this concept cafe to study what makes spaces go viral.
What makes people screenshot and share?
What triggers "I need to go there"?

[12-22s] THE ELEMENTS
Every viral cafe has three things:
1. One signature design element (the "hero")
2. Perfect natural light
3. Instagrammable seating

[22-42s] THE BUILD
I started with a design brief in ChatGPT:
"Japanese minimalism meets Parisian patisserie,
arched windows, terrazzo floors, one dramatic chandelier."

Then I generated the interior in Midjourney.
Multiple angles. Different times of day.
Added menu mockups and branding to complete the story.

[42-52s] RESULT
People asking for the address.
Investors in my DMs.
A concept that could actually get funded—built in an afternoon.

[52-58s] CTA
Comment "CAFE" and I'll send you the full concept deck.
```

## DAY 11: "Most AI Brands Look Like AI Brands"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "FIX"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Most AI brands look like AI brands.
Overprocessed. Uncanny. Obviously fake.
Here's how to fix it.

[3-12s] THE PROBLEM
You're using AI like a filter, not a camera.
Cranking up the detail, the saturation, the drama.
And it screams "I couldn't afford a photographer."

[12-20s] THE REAL ISSUE
AI defaults to "impressive."
But impressive isn't believable.
And brands need believability to convert.

[20-42s] THE FIX
Three rules for AI imagery that passes as real:

1. EMBRACE IMPERFECTION
Add grain. Add blur. Add a slightly off-center composition.
Real photos aren't perfect—yours shouldn't be either.

2. MATCH REAL REFERENCES
Don't prompt from imagination. Screenshot real editorials
and describe what you see.

3. POST-PROCESS LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHER
Color grade. Add lens effects. Compress the dynamic range.

[42-50s] RESULT
Same AI. Different output.
Nobody asking "is this Midjourney?"

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "FIX" and I'll send you my post-processing workflow.
```

## DAY 12: "I Made a Perfume Ad for $0"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "PERFUME"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This perfume ad cost $0 to make.
Same agency would charge $50,000.

[3-12s] TRADITIONAL PROCESS
A typical perfume campaign:
- Creative director: $5K
- Photographer: $10K
- Model: $5K
- Studio + styling: $8K
- Post-production: $4K
- Months of back and forth

[12-20s] MY PROCESS
One evening. One laptop.
ChatGPT for concept. Midjourney for execution.
Runway for the motion version.

[20-45s] THE BUILD
Concept: "Nocturnal elegance. Black orchid. Midnight garden."
I described the feeling, not the product.

Visual prompt: [show prompt]
"Editorial perfume photography, single bottle emerging from
black liquid, orchid petals floating,
dramatic side lighting, Phase One medium format look"

Then I animated the still in Runway Gen-3.
Subtle motion. The liquid ripples. Petals drift.

[45-55s] RESULT
Campaign-ready creative.
Motion and stills.
Total time: 2 hours.

[55-60s] CTA
Comment "PERFUME" and I'll send you the complete prompt and workflow.
```

## DAY 13: "Why Your Restaurant Branding Fails"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "RESTO"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your restaurant branding fails because you're showing food.
That's it. That's the problem.

[3-10s] THE MISTAKE
Every restaurant account: hero shot of the dish.
Overhead angle. Perfect plating. Zero personality.
You're competing with 10 million other food photos.

[10-18s] THE SHIFT
The restaurants that win don't lead with food.
They lead with FEELING.
The vibe. The crowd. The moment.

[18-38s] EXAMPLES
Carbone doesn't post pasta—they post the red leather booths.
Nobu doesn't post sushi—they post the scene.
The food is the excuse. The experience is the brand.

Here's how I rebuilt a taco spot with this approach:
Instead of tacos: the neon sign reflection on wet pavement.
Instead of plating: hands reaching across the table.
Instead of ingredients: the worn-in bar stools.

[38-46s] RESULT
Same restaurant. 10x more engaging.
People want to BE there, not just eat there.

[46-52s] CTA
Comment "RESTO" and I'll send you the mood board prompts.
```

## DAY 14: "This Fashion Brand Made $0 and Has 50K Followers"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "FASHION"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This fashion brand has 50,000 followers.
Editorial campaigns. Influencer reposts.
It's made exactly zero dollars.
Because the clothes don't exist.

[3-12s] WHY I BUILT IT
I wanted to test a theory:
Can you build brand equity before you have a product?
Can you create demand for something that isn't real yet?

[12-22s] THE ANSWER
Yes. Absolutely yes.
In 6 weeks, I built a following for a brand
that's just AI-generated lookbooks.
People asking when they can buy.
Investors asking for the deck.

[22-42s] THE STRATEGY
I treated it like a real brand:
- Consistent visual identity
- Regular posting schedule
- Behind-the-scenes "studio" content (also AI)
- Influencer-style shots that people screenshot

The product doesn't need to exist
for the brand to create value.

[42-52s] THE LESSON
In 2026, you can validate a brand before manufacturing.
Build the audience first.
Let demand tell you what to actually produce.

[52-58s] CTA
Comment "FASHION" and I'll send you the full brand playbook.
```

# WEEK 3: MASTER THE TOOLS

---

## DAY 15: "Midjourney 7 Changed Everything"
**Hook Type:** Announcement
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "V7"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Midjourney V7 just dropped.
And it changes how we approach product photography.

[3-12s] WHAT'S NEW
Coherence is solved.
Hands look right. Text is readable.
But the real upgrade? Lighting control.

[12-25s] THE BREAKTHROUGH
You can now specify:
- Light position
- Shadow softness
- Reflection intensity
- Time of day

This means studio-quality product shots
without understanding studio lighting.

[25-42s] DEMONSTRATION
Here's the same product, three lighting setups:
- Soft diffused: e-commerce friendly
- Dramatic side light: editorial impact
- Backlit: lifestyle mood

Same prompt base. Just adjust the lighting parameters.

[42-48s] RESULT
What used to require a photographer
now requires one line in your prompt.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "V7" and I'll send you my lighting prompt cheat sheet.
```

---

## DAY 16: "You're Using Flux Wrong"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "FLUX"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
You're using Flux wrong.
That's why your outputs still look AI-generated.

[3-10s] THE MISTAKE
You're treating Flux like Midjourney.
Detailed prompts. Stacked modifiers.
But Flux doesn't want that.

[10-18s] HOW FLUX WORKS
Flux is trained differently.
It wants NATURAL LANGUAGE, not keyword stacking.
Write like you're describing a photo to a friend.

[18-35s] EXAMPLE
BAD: "Product photography, skincare bottle, marble surface,
soft lighting, bokeh, 8K, hyperrealistic, octane render"

GOOD: "A single moisturizer bottle sits on a marble
bathroom counter. Morning light from a window to the left
casts a soft shadow. There's a small water droplet
on the bottle's surface."

[35-45s] RESULT
Flux responds to story, not specifications.
The more natural your prompt, the more natural the output.

[45-50s] RESULT DEMO
Same product. Completely different quality.
One screams AI. One passes as real.

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "FLUX" and I'll send you my Flux prompt translator.
```

---

## DAY 17: "The ChatGPT Prompt That Built My Last 5 Brands"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "MASTER"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
One ChatGPT prompt built my last 5 brands.
Not five prompts. One.

[3-10s] CONTEXT
Most people use ChatGPT for one-off requests.
"Write me a tagline." "Give me a color palette."
That's using a Ferrari to get groceries.

[10-20s] MY APPROACH
I built a master prompt that generates
EVERYTHING for a new brand:
- Name options
- Positioning statement
- Visual identity description
- Tone of voice
- Midjourney prompt templates
- Content pillars

[20-42s] HOW IT WORKS
The prompt asks me 5 questions about my brand concept.
Then it generates a complete brand bible.
I copy the visual description directly into Midjourney.
Instant cohesion across every image.

[42-52s] EXAMPLE
I fed it "luxury minimalist pet accessories."
Got back "Haus & Hound"—neutral palette, architectural
photography style, understated premium.
Every visual decision made in 3 minutes.

[52-60s] CTA
Comment "MASTER" and I'll DM you the exact prompt.
```

---

## DAY 18: "Magnific AI Is Cheating"
**Hook Type:** Announcement
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "MAG"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Magnific AI is basically cheating.
And nobody's talking about it enough.

[3-10s] WHAT IT DOES
It upscales AND adds detail.
Not just bigger pixels—new information.
Textures that weren't there. Depth that didn't exist.

[10-20s] WHY IT MATTERS
Midjourney outputs are good.
Magnific outputs are print-ready.

I can generate at 1024px, upscale to 8K,
and deliver files that work for billboards.

[20-38s] MY WORKFLOW
Generate in Midjourney at standard resolution.
Pick winners.
Run through Magnific with these settings: [show settings]
Creativity at 3—enough to enhance, not enough to change.

[38-45s] RESULT
What comes out looks like it was shot
on a $50,000 medium format camera.
Skin texture. Fabric detail. Micro-reflections.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "MAG" and I'll send you my Magnific settings template.
```

## DAY 19: "Stop Using AI Like a Slot Machine"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 54s
**CTA Trigger:** "SYSTEM"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Stop using AI like a slot machine.
Generate, generate, generate—hoping you get lucky.
That's not a workflow. That's gambling.

[3-12s] THE PROBLEM
I see people pull 200 images looking for one good one.
That's a 0.5% success rate.
That's a waste of time and credits.

[12-20s] THE FIX
Build a SYSTEM.
Every image you generate should be
closer to what you want—not random shots in the dark.

[20-40s] MY SYSTEM
1. REFERENCE FIRST
Before I prompt, I find 3-5 images that capture what I want.
Real photos. Not AI.

2. DESCRIBE, DON'T IMAGINE
I describe those references in detail.
What makes them work? Lighting? Composition? Mood?

3. ITERATE METHODICALLY
First generation: Get the structure right.
Second: Nail the lighting.
Third: Perfect the details.

[40-50s] RESULT
80% of my generations are usable.
Because I'm directing, not hoping.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "SYSTEM" and I'll send you my reference-to-prompt workflow.
```

## DAY 20: "The AI Tool Nobody's Using for Brands"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "HIDDEN"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Everyone's using Midjourney.
Almost nobody's using the tool that makes Midjourney actually useful.

[3-10s] THE TOOL
Ideogram for text.
That's it. That's the secret.

[10-18s] THE PROBLEM WITH MIDJOURNEY
Midjourney can't do text reliably.
Logos with words. Packaging with labels. Signs.
It's the one thing that constantly fails.

[18-35s] THE SOLUTION
I generate my scenes in Midjourney.
Then I generate text elements in Ideogram.
Composite them in Photoshop.

Takes 5 extra minutes.
Saves hours of prompt wrestling.

[35-45s] EXAMPLE
This beer brand: Midjourney for the bottle and setting.
Ideogram for the label with actual readable text.
Combined: Looks like a real product.

[45-52s] RESULT
Perfect text. Every time.
No more "close enough" labels.

[52-58s] CTA
Comment "HIDDEN" and I'll send you my Midjourney + Ideogram workflow.
```

## DAY 21: "Your Color Grading Is the Problem"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "COLOR"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your color grading is the problem.
That's why your AI images still look like AI.

[3-10s] THE TELL
AI images are too clean. Too saturated. Too perfect.
Real photos have personality baked into the color.
Film stocks. Camera profiles. Stylistic choices.

[10-18s] WHAT'S MISSING
Midjourney doesn't know your brand's color story.
It gives you "good" colors.
But "good" isn't "yours."

[18-38s] THE FIX
Every image needs post-processing.
Even the perfect ones.

Here's my workflow:
1. Reduce saturation 10-15%
2. Add a slight color cast (usually warm shadows, cool highlights)
3. Apply film grain
4. Adjust individual color channels for brand consistency

[38-48s] EXAMPLE
Same image. Before and after.
Before: Looks like everyone else's Midjourney.
After: Looks like YOUR brand.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "COLOR" and I'll send you my Lightroom preset pack.

# WEEK 4: SCALE THE SYSTEM

---

## DAY 22: "How I Create 30 Days of Content in One Afternoon"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "BATCH"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
I create 30 days of content in one afternoon.
Here's the exact system.

[3-12s] THE OLD WAY
Create content daily.
Scramble for ideas. Rush the execution.
Burn out in 3 weeks.

[12-20s] THE NEW WAY
Batch everything.
One day of focused creation beats 30 days of scattered effort.

[20-45s] THE SYSTEM
PHASE 1: IDEATION (1 hour)
I list 30 hook concepts using my templates.
Attack hooks, reveals, tutorials.
Don't overthink—just fill the slots.

PHASE 2: VISUAL CREATION (2 hours)
I generate all primary images for the month.
Same settings, same style—just different content.
Consistency comes from workflow, not memory.

PHASE 3: SCRIPTING (2 hours)
I write all 30 scripts.
Same structure. Different topics.
By script 10, I'm on autopilot.

PHASE 4: SCHEDULING (30 min)
Everything queued. Done.

[45-55s] RESULT
5.5 hours of work.
30 days of content.
The rest of the month, I just engage.

[55-62s] CTA
Comment "BATCH" and I'll send you my content calendar template.
```

---

## DAY 23: "The DM Automation That Prints Leads"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "DM"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Every comment on my posts triggers an automatic DM.
It runs while I sleep.
It's generated 300+ leads this month.

[3-12s] HOW IT WORKS
You've seen the comment triggers:
"Comment BRAND for the prompt."
"Drop SKIN below and I'll DM you."

Those comments trigger an automation.
Instant DM with the resource.
Plus a follow-up sequence.

[12-25s] THE TECH STACK
ManyChat connected to Instagram.
Keyword triggers: One word activates a flow.
The flow delivers value THEN pitches.

[25-42s] THE PSYCHOLOGY
People who comment are engaged.
People who receive value trust you.
People who trust you buy.

The automation moves people from
"random viewer" to "warm lead" without me doing anything.

[42-50s] RESULT
Comment section drives DMs.
DMs drive email list.
Email list drives revenue.

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "DM" and I'll send you my ManyChat flow template.
```

## DAY 24: "Why Your Fake Brand Should Become Real"
**Hook Type:** Philosophical
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "LAUNCH"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
At what point does a fake brand become real?

[4-12s] CONTEXT
I've built 12 "fake" brands in the last 6 months.
Brands with followers. Engagement. Anticipation.
No products. Just vibes and AI imagery.

[12-22s] THE REALIZATION
Three of those brands got acquisition offers.
Not for the products—for the AUDIENCE.
For the brand equity.
For the proven concept.

[22-38s] THE SHIFT
Here's what I realized:
The traditional path is backwards.
Build product → then find audience → hope it works.

The new path:
Build audience → validate demand → THEN build product.

Your "fake" brand is market research that pays you back.

[38-50s] EXAMPLE
My fake skincare brand got 4,000 followers before I made anything.
The comments told me exactly what products to make first.
When I launched, I had customers waiting.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "LAUNCH" and I'll send you my validation-to-production framework.
```

---

## DAY 25: "The Template That Keeps Me Consistent"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "TEMPLATE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
One template keeps every brand I build visually consistent.
I use it for everything.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
Most people generate images randomly.
Every session, slightly different settings.
The result: A feed that looks like five different brands.

[10-18s] THE SOLUTION
I built a master prompt template.
It holds my style constants—every variable that
shouldn't change between images.

[18-35s] THE TEMPLATE
Base format:
[SUBJECT], [brand name] style, [lighting description],
[color palette], [camera specs], [mood keywords]

I only change [SUBJECT] for each image.
Everything else stays locked.

[35-45s] EXAMPLE
20 images for a coffee brand.
Different compositions, different content.
Same lighting. Same colors. Same energy.
Scrollable cohesion.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "TEMPLATE" and I'll send you my master prompt format.
```

---

## DAY 26: "I Spent $0 on Ads—Here's What I Did Instead"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "ZERO"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
I've never spent a dollar on ads for my brands.
I don't need to.
The content IS the marketing.

[3-12s] THE TRADITIONAL PATH
Build brand → Create content → Pay for reach → Convert.
The math only works if your margins are healthy
and your content is average.

[12-22s] MY PATH
Create content SO good it spreads on its own.
Use AI to produce 10x more than competitors.
Let the volume and quality do the work.

[22-40s] THE STRATEGY
I treat every post like an ad.
Hook in the first second.
Value or entertainment throughout.
CTA at the end.

Then I post 2-3x per day.
Different formats. Same brand.
Organic reach compounds.

[40-50s] THE MATH
100 posts per month.
Average 5,000 views each.
500,000 monthly impressions.
Cost: $0.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "ZERO" and I'll send you my organic growth playbook.
```

---

## DAY 27: "Your Portfolio Should Be Fake Brands"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "PORT"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your portfolio sucks because it only shows real work.
That's the problem.

[3-10s] THE ISSUE
You're waiting for clients to give you good projects.
But clients hire based on your portfolio.
Chicken and egg.

[10-18s] THE SOLUTION
Build the portfolio you want.
With fake brands you'd love to work on.

[18-35s] WHY IT WORKS
Nobody asks "was this a real client?"
They ask "can you make something like this for me?"

When you show a fake luxury hotel brand you designed,
real luxury hotels see what you could do for them.
When you show a fake restaurant rebrand,
restaurants see their potential in your work.

[35-45s] EXAMPLE
I built 8 fake brand projects.
They've brought in more client inquiries than
all my "real" work combined.
Because I designed what I WANTED, not what I was given.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "PORT" and I'll send you my portfolio project framework.
```

---

## DAY 28: "The Fake Brand That Got Funded"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "FUNDED"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This brand started as a TikTok experiment.
AI-generated products. Zero inventory.
It just raised $400K.

[3-12s] THE STORY
I built a fake home goods brand as content.
Minimal furniture. Architectural vibes.
Posted consistently for 4 months.

[12-22s] WHAT HAPPENED
The audience grew. The engagement was real.
Then investors started reaching out.
"We love the brand. Can we talk?"

[22-38s] THE PITCH
I told them the truth: Nothing exists yet.
No products. No supply chain. No nothing.
Just AI imagery and a proven concept.

They said: "That's actually better.
You've validated demand without inventory risk.
You know exactly what to build."

[38-50s] THE LESSON
In 2026, a brand doesn't need products to have value.
It needs audience, aesthetic, and proven demand.
The products are the easy part.

[50-60s] CTA
Comment "FUNDED" and I'll break down exactly how we structured it.
```

---

## DAY 29: "RIP Graphic Design Degrees"
**Hook Type:** Death Announcement
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "DEGREE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Rest in peace, graphic design degrees.
4 years and $100K for skills AI does in seconds.

[3-10s] THE HARD TRUTH
I'm not saying designers are useless.
I'm saying the barrier to entry just collapsed.

[10-20s] WHAT MATTERED
Old world: Technical skills. Software proficiency.
Can you use the tools?

New world: Creative direction. Taste. Strategy.
Can you GUIDE the tools?

[20-35s] THE SHIFT
A designer's value is no longer in execution.
It's in vision.

The kid who understands aesthetics, brand psychology,
and visual storytelling beats the
technician who spent 4 years learning Illustrator.

[35-45s] MY TAKE
If you're in design school, pivot to strategy.
Learn WHY things work, not just HOW to make them.
AI handles the how.
Humans handle the why.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "DEGREE" and I'll send you my creative direction framework.
```

---

## DAY 30: "What's Next for Fake Brands"
**Hook Type:** Philosophical
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "FUTURE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
What happens when everyone can build a brand overnight?

[4-12s] THE CURRENT MOMENT
Right now, this is an edge.
AI imagery. Rapid prototyping. Fake-it-til-you-make-it branding.
It works because most people don't know how.

[12-22s] THE NEAR FUTURE
In 12 months, everyone will know.
The tools will be easier. The techniques will be common.
The advantage will disappear.

[22-38s] WHAT REMAINS
When creation is commoditized, curation matters.
When execution is easy, strategy wins.
When everyone has the same tools,
TASTE becomes the differentiator.

[38-50s] THE PLAY
Learn the tools now while they're an advantage.
Build the audience while it's easier.
Develop your eye while others are still figuring out the basics.

By the time everyone catches up,
you'll have the foundation they're still building.

[50-58s] CTA
This is just the beginning.
Comment "FUTURE" and I'll send you what I'm working on next.
```

# WEEK 5: VIDEO IS THE NEW PHOTO (OHNEIS CONTENT)

---

## DAY 31: "AI Is The New Camera"
**Hook Type:** Death Announcement (ohneis652's #1 viral - 731K plays)
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "CAMERA"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
It's officially over.
AI is the new camera.

[3-12s] THE SHIFT
Last year we were generating static images.
This year we're directing full commercials.
The tools caught up to our imagination.

[12-22s] WHAT CHANGED
Sora 2 just dropped.
Runway Gen-3 is insane.
Kling can do things that cost $50K last year.

[22-42s] DEMONSTRATION
Watch this:
I wrote a 2-sentence prompt for a perfume ad.
"Slow push through morning mist. A single bottle
catches light as petals drift past."

45 seconds later, I had broadcast-quality footage.
No camera. No crew. No location scout.

[42-52s] WHAT THIS MEANS
The brands that figure this out first win.
Everyone else is paying for yesterday's tools.

[52-58s] CTA
Comment "CAMERA" and I'll send you my video prompt library.
```

---

## DAY 32: "Sora 2 Just Changed Everything"
**Hook Type:** Tool Announcement
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "SORA"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Sora 2 is here.
I tested it for 6 hours straight.
Here's what you need to know.

[3-12s] WHAT'S DIFFERENT
Consistency is solved.
Your character doesn't morph mid-scene.
The physics actually make sense.
And the runtime went from 5 seconds to 20.

[12-25s] THE BIG UPGRADE
But here's the real game-changer:
You can now extend clips.
Generate 5 seconds, extend to 20, extend again.
Continuous storytelling was impossible before.

[25-42s] DEMONSTRATION
I made this entire ad in one session:
Opening wide shot → push into product →
hero moment → logo resolve.

One prompt chain. One consistent style.
This used to require 4 different tools and prayer.

[42-50s] THE CATCH
It's still expensive.
But for hero content? Worth every credit.

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "SORA" and I'll send you my prompt chain templates.
```

## DAY 33: "Your AI Videos Look Like AI Videos"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "MOTION"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your AI videos look like AI videos.
That weird smoothness. That uncanny motion.
Here's the fix.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
AI video models default to "dreamy."
Everything floats. Nothing has weight.
It's beautiful but obviously fake.

[10-20s] WHY IT HAPPENS
These models were trained on cinematic footage.
Slow motion. Flowing fabric. Gentle movement.
That's what they know.

[20-38s] THE FIX
You have to BREAK the dreaminess.

Three techniques:
1. ADD SUDDEN MOVEMENT - A hand entering frame. A quick pan.
2. INCLUDE IMPERFECTION - Shaky cam. Focus pulls.
3. CUT OFTEN - Don't let any clip run too long.

[38-48s] EXAMPLE
Same scene. Default settings vs. intentional chaos.
One looks like a tech demo.
One looks like an actual commercial.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "MOTION" and I'll send you my realism settings.
```

---

## DAY 34: "Nano Banana Changed How I Make Ads"
**Hook Type:** Tool Review
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "BANANA"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Nano Banana just changed how I make ads.
Not because it's better.
Because it's different.

[3-12s] CONTEXT
Most AI video tools try to be everything.
Nano Banana does ONE thing:
Product shots that look like they cost $30K.

[12-22s] WHAT IT DOES
You upload a product photo.
It generates motion around it.
Liquid. Smoke. Particles. Light.

No prompting required.
Just vibes.

[22-40s] DEMONSTRATION
Watch this:
I dropped in a perfume bottle.
Two minutes later: cinematic commercial.

The liquid swirls. The light refracts.
The camera pushes in with perfect timing.

[40-50s] WHEN TO USE IT
This isn't for everything.
It's for that ONE hero shot.
The opener. The money moment.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "BANANA" and I'll show you my exact workflow.
```

---

## DAY 35: "Why Are You Still Paying for Stock Video?"
**Hook Type:** Question
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "STOCKVID"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Why are you still paying for stock video?
$199/month for clips everyone's already used.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
Stock video is:
- Generic
- Overused
- Never quite right

You're settling for "close enough"
when you could have "exactly this."

[10-22s] THE ALTERNATIVE
I haven't bought stock footage in 8 months.
Every B-roll on my feed? Generated.
Custom. On-brand. Mine.

[22-38s] HOW I DO IT
Runway for motion.
Kling for people.
Pika for abstract.

Different tools for different needs.
Same result: footage that doesn't exist anywhere else.

[38-46s] THE MATH
Monthly AI video tools: ~$80
Monthly stock subscription: $199
Quality difference: No contest.

[46-52s] CTA
Comment "STOCKVID" and I'll send you my tool comparison chart.
```

---

## DAY 36: "If It Feels Real, Does It Matter That It's Generated?"
**Hook Type:** Philosophical (ohneis652's #3 viral - 229K plays)
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "FEEL"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
If it feels real, does it matter that it's generated?

[4-12s] CONTEXT
I showed this product video to 20 marketing directors.
Didn't tell them it was AI.
17 wanted to know our production company.

[12-22s] THE REACTION
When I revealed it was generated,
half of them said "doesn't matter—it works."
Half said "feels dishonest."

[22-35s] THE TENSION
We're in a weird transition moment.
AI video is indistinguishable from real video.
But the disclosure feels like a gotcha.

[35-48s] MY TAKE
Here's where I land:
If the product is real and delivers,
the marketing is just... marketing.
We've been creating fictional scenarios in ads forever.
AI just makes it cheaper.

[48-55s] QUESTION
Where do you draw the line?
Authentic product, generated visuals—okay?
Let me know in the comments.

[55-60s] CTA
Comment "FEEL" and I'll send you the prompts I used.
```

---

## DAY 37: "LTX-Video Is Free and Nobody's Talking About It"
**Hook Type:** Tool Reveal
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "LTX"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
LTX-Video is completely free.
And nobody's talking about it.

[3-10s] WHAT IT IS
Open source video model.
Runs locally on your machine.
No credits. No subscription. No limits.

[10-20s] WHY IT MATTERS
Every other video tool charges per second.
$0.10 here, $0.25 there.
Suddenly your experimentation budget is gone.

LTX? Generate 100 clips learning.
Generate 1000 clips testing.
It costs electricity.

[20-38s] THE QUALITY
Is it as good as Sora? No.
Is it good ENOUGH for testing? Absolutely.

I prototype in LTX.
When I find what works, I regenerate in Sora or Runway.
Best of both worlds.

[38-48s] THE SETUP
It runs on a decent GPU.
Install takes 20 minutes.
I'll walk you through it.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "LTX" and I'll send you the setup guide.
```

# WEEK 6: MASTER AI VIDEO PRODUCTION

---

## DAY 38: "Your Video Ads Are Too Safe"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "BOLD"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your video ads are too safe.
Too slow. Too predictable. Too boring.
Nobody's watching past second 2.

[3-10s] THE DATA
Average scroll speed: 0.7 seconds per post.
You have less than a second to stop someone.
And you're opening with a logo fade?

[10-20s] WHAT WORKS NOW
The first frame needs to be the most interesting.
Not a build-up. Not context.
Chaos. Intrigue. Movement.

[20-38s] MY FORMULA
Frame 1: Already in motion. Something unexpected.
Second 1-3: The hook—visual AND verbal.
Second 3-10: Deliver or they're gone.

[38-46s] EXAMPLE
Old approach: Logo → product → features → CTA
New approach: Product exploding into frame → hook → CTA

[46-52s] CTA
Comment "BOLD" and I'll send you first-frame templates.
```

## DAY 39: "I Made a Super Bowl Quality Ad for $0"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "SUPER"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This ad looks like it cost $500,000.
Production crew. Celebrity. Stadium location.
I made it in my apartment for $0.

[3-12s] THE CONTEXT
Super Bowl ads cost ~$7M for the slot.
Plus $1-5M for production.
They're designed to be cinematic events.

[12-22s] THE CHALLENGE
I wanted to see:
Can AI create that same emotional scale?
That same "this feels expensive" quality?

[22-45s] THE BUILD
Scene 1: Generated epic stadium in Sora.
Scene 2: AI athlete in Runway.
Scene 3: Product hero in Nano Banana.
Scene 4: Logo resolve in After Effects.

Music: Licensed for $15.
Voiceover: ElevenLabs.
Color grade: DaVinci Resolve.

[45-55s] THE RESULT
30 seconds of "how much did this cost?"
Answer: 6 hours of my time.
That's it.

[55-62s] CTA
Comment "SUPER" and I'll send you the full production breakdown.
```

---

## DAY 40: "Runway Gen-3 vs Sora vs Kling"
**Hook Type:** Comparison
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "COMPARE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Which AI video tool should you actually use?
I tested all three. Here's the truth.

[3-15s] RUNWAY GEN-3
Best for: Stylized content, motion control
Weakness: Expensive, shorter clips
Use when: You need specific camera moves

[15-27s] SORA 2
Best for: Cinematic realism, long takes
Weakness: Very expensive, limited access
Use when: Hero content that needs to be perfect

[27-40s] KLING
Best for: People, faces, lip sync
Weakness: Less artistic control
Use when: You need humans that don't look weird

[40-50s] MY WORKFLOW
I use all three.
Kling for people shots.
Runway for stylized transitions.
Sora for that ONE hero moment.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "COMPARE" and I'll send you my decision matrix.
```

---

## DAY 41: "The Prompt That Makes AI Video Look Real"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "REALPROMPT"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
One prompt pattern makes AI video look real.
I add it to everything.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
Default AI video is too smooth.
Too perfect. Too... AI.
Real cameras don't work that way.

[10-18s] THE PATTERN
At the end of every prompt, I add:
"Shot on handheld 35mm, subtle camera movement,
natural motion blur, occasional focus shift."

[18-35s] WHY IT WORKS
You're telling the AI to be imperfect.
To simulate the little errors real cameras make.

A tripod is steady.
A human holding a camera is not.
Humans read the difference subconsciously.

[35-48s] EXAMPLE
Same prompt, with and without the pattern.
One looks like a tech demo.
One looks like someone actually filmed it.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "REALPROMPT" for my full prompt suffix library.
```

## DAY 42: "We're Witnessing the Death of Stock"
**Hook Type:** Death Announcement (ohneis652 style)
**Duration:** 54s
**CTA Trigger:** "DEATH"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
We're witnessing the death of stock footage.
And honestly? Good riddance.

[3-12s] THE OLD WORLD
Stock footage was a compromise.
"We can't afford to shoot this, so..."
"This isn't quite right, but..."
Every project settled for less.

[12-22s] THE NEW REALITY
Custom footage on demand.
Exactly what you imagined.
No licensing fees. No usage restrictions.

[22-38s] WHAT THIS MEANS
Stock companies are scrambling.
Getty is suing AI companies.
Shutterstock is pivoting to AI tools.

The writing is on the wall:
Why pay for generic when custom is free?

[38-50s] THE OPPORTUNITY
Right now, most people still default to stock.
Muscle memory.
The creators using AI stand out.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "DEATH" and I'll send you my stock replacement workflow.

## DAY 43: "How to Make AI Video Look Like Film"
**Hook Type:** Tutorial
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "FILM"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
AI video looks digital.
Film looks timeless.
Here's how to bridge the gap.

[3-12s] THE DIFFERENCE
Film has grain, halation, and color roll-off.
It has imperfection built in.
AI is too clean by default.

[12-25s] THE PROCESS
Step 1: Generate your clip normally.
Step 2: Export at highest quality.
Step 3: Apply film emulation in post.

[25-42s] THE TOOLS
DaVinci Resolve: Free, powerful color grading.
Film grain overlays: Hundreds free online.
Halation plugins: Add that film bloom.

[42-52s] DEMONSTRATION
Before: Clean, digital, obviously AI.
After: Grain, warmth, texture.
Same footage. Completely different feel.

[52-60s] CTA
Comment "FILM" and I'll send you my film grade preset pack.
```

## DAY 44: "Your B-Roll Is Killing Your Videos"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "BROLL"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your B-roll is killing your videos.
Stock footage of "teamwork" isn't helping.

[3-10s] THE PROBLEM
Random B-roll distracts.
It fills space without adding meaning.
Your viewer's brain disconnects.

[10-20s] WHAT TO DO INSTEAD
Every cut should advance the story.
Or reinforce the emotion.
Or introduce information.

If it doesn't do one of those, cut it.

[20-35s] AI B-ROLL STRATEGY
Don't generate random pretty shots.
Generate SPECIFIC supporting visuals.

Talking about speed? Show velocity.
Talking about luxury? Show texture.
Match the word to the image.

[35-45s] EXAMPLE
Same script. Random B-roll vs. intentional.
Retention difference: 40%.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "BROLL" and I'll send you my B-roll matching framework.
```

## DAY 45: "I Built a Full Commercial in 2 Hours"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "2HOURS"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This commercial took 2 hours to make.
Total cost: $12 in AI credits.
Let me show you exactly how.

[3-12s] THE BRIEF
Luxury watch brand.
Cinematic. Elegant. Aspirational.
30 seconds for Instagram and YouTube.

[12-25s] HOUR 1: CREATION
5 minutes: Script and shot list in ChatGPT.
20 minutes: Generate 8 hero shots in Midjourney.
25 minutes: Animate 3 key shots in Runway.
10 minutes: Generate product motion in Nano Banana.

[25-42s] HOUR 2: POST
15 minutes: Edit and sequence in Premiere.
20 minutes: Color grade in DaVinci.
15 minutes: Sound design and music.
10 minutes: Export and optimize.

[42-52s] THE RESULT
Broadcast-quality commercial.
Client-ready.
Two hours of work.

[52-58s] CTA
Comment "2HOURS" and I'll send you my shot list template.
```

## DAY 46: "The Secret to Consistent AI Characters"
**Hook Type:** Tutorial
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "CHAR"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Keeping AI characters consistent was impossible.
Now it's easy.
Here's the workflow.

[3-12s] THE OLD PROBLEM
Generate a face.
Try to generate it again.
Completely different person.

Consistency broke entire projects.

[12-22s] THE FIX: REFERENCE IMAGES
Generate ONE perfect face first.
Then use it as reference for every future shot.

Midjourney: --cref [image URL]
Runway: Character reference upload
Kling: Face lock feature

[22-40s] MY PROCESS
1. Generate 20 face options.
2. Pick the winner.
3. Upscale and save as master reference.
4. Use that reference in every new prompt.

[40-50s] RESULT
Same character across 15 different shots.
Different angles. Different lighting.
Same person.

[50-55s] CTA
Comment "CHAR" and I'll send you the character Bible template.
```

## DAY 47: "Most AI Workflows Are Lazy"
**Hook Type:** Attack (ohneis652's #4 viral - 149K plays)
**Duration:** 54s
**CTA Trigger:** "WORKFLOW"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Most AI workflows are lazy.
That's why your results still look flat—
like filters, not direction.

[3-12s] THE PATTERN
Generate → Pick best one → Post.
That's not a workflow.
That's slot machine thinking.

[12-22s] WHAT PROS DO
Research → Reference → Test → Iterate → Perfect → Post.

The difference isn't talent.
It's process.

[22-40s] MY WORKFLOW
1. Collect 10+ reference images.
2. Analyze what makes them work.
3. Write a detailed prompt brief.
4. Generate 20 variations.
5. Pick top 3, iterate on those.
6. Post-process extensively.
7. THEN post.

[40-50s] THE RESULT
My first generation is never my final.
My final is 4-5 iterations deep.
That's what separates "good" from "undeniably good."

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "WORKFLOW" and I'll send you my iteration tracker.
```

# WEEK 8: MONETIZE & SCALE

---

## DAY 48: "How I Charge $5K for AI Commercials"
**Hook Type:** Reveal
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "5K"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
I charge $5,000 for commercials that cost me $50 to make.
And clients are happy to pay.
Here's why.

[3-12s] THE MATH
My costs:
- AI tools: ~$100/month
- Per project: Maybe $50 in credits
- Time: 4-6 hours

Client's alternative:
- Production company: $20K-100K
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks

[12-25s] THE VALUE PROPOSITION
I'm not selling AI generation.
I'm selling:
- Speed (deliver in days, not months)
- Creative direction
- Unlimited iterations
- Final broadcast-quality assets

[25-40s] HOW I FRAME IT
"I use cutting-edge AI tools to deliver
agency-quality creative at a fraction of the cost and time."

They don't care how it's made.
They care about the outcome.

[40-52s] THE PORTFOLIO
Built fake brands for 6 months.
That portfolio got me real clients.
The work speaks for itself.

[52-60s] CTA
Comment "5K" and I'll send you my client proposal template.
```

## DAY 49: "The AI Video Agency Model"
**Hook Type:** Business Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "AGENCY"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
AI video agencies are the next wave.
Low overhead. High margins. Infinite scale.

[3-12s] THE MODEL
Traditional agency: 20 employees, $500K overhead
AI agency: 2-3 people, $5K overhead

Same output. Different economics.

[12-22s] THE SERVICES
1. Social content packages (monthly retainer)
2. Ad creative (per project)
3. Brand video (premium pricing)
4. Concept development (strategy tier)

[22-40s] THE PRICING
Social package: $2K-5K/month for 20-30 videos
Ad creative: $3K-10K per campaign
Brand video: $5K-25K per video
Strategy: $1K-3K per session

[40-50s] THE TEAM
You need:
- Creative director (you)
- Video editor (part-time)
- Maybe an account manager

That's it.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "AGENCY" and I'll send you the full business model breakdown.
```

---

## DAY 50: "Your AI Side Hustle Is Backwards"
**Hook Type:** Attack
**Duration:** 50s
**CTA Trigger:** "FLIP"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Your AI side hustle is backwards.
You're selling the wrong thing.

[3-10s] THE MISTAKE
Selling AI images on Etsy: $5 profit.
Selling AI services to businesses: $5,000 profit.
Same skills. 1000x different outcome.

[10-20s] THE REFRAME
Stop selling outputs.
Start selling outcomes.

Businesses don't buy images.
They buy "marketing that converts."
They buy "content that scales."
They buy "speed and quality."

[20-38s] WHERE THE MONEY IS
- E-commerce brands need product content
- Real estate needs listing videos
- Restaurants need social content
- Coaches need course visuals

They have budgets. They have problems.
You have solutions.

[38-48s] THE SWITCH
Stop competing on Fiverr for $50.
Start reaching out to businesses directly.
Pitch outcomes, not outputs.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "FLIP" and I'll send you my outreach templates.
```

## DAY 51: "I Made $12K Last Month with AI Video"
**Hook Type:** Income Reveal
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "12K"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
$12,000 last month.
Part-time hours.
AI video and nothing else.

[3-12s] THE BREAKDOWN
3 monthly retainers: $2K each = $6K
1 ad campaign project: $4K
2 small one-offs: $1K each = $2K

Total: $12,000

[12-22s] THE TIME INVESTMENT
Retainers: ~15 hours/month total
Campaign: ~8 hours
One-offs: ~4 hours

Total time: ~27 hours

[22-38s] HOURLY MATH
$12,000 / 27 hours = $444/hour

Compare that to:
- Traditional freelance: $50-150/hour
- Day job: Whatever you're making

[38-50s] THE CAVEAT
Month 1 wasn't like this.
Month 1 was building portfolio.
Month 2 was outreach.
Month 3 was one client.
Month 5 was this.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "12K" and I'll show you the exact client acquisition timeline.
```

## DAY 52: "The Content Machine Stack"
**Hook Type:** Tutorial
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "STACK"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
This is my exact tool stack.
What I use for everything.

[3-15s] IMAGE GENERATION
Midjourney: Primary tool, V6.1
Flux: When I need realism
Ideogram: Text and logos

[15-27s] VIDEO GENERATION
Sora 2: Hero content
Runway Gen-3: Stylized/controlled
Kling: People and faces
LTX: Free experimentation

[27-40s] POST-PRODUCTION
Magnific: Upscaling
Topaz: Video enhancement
DaVinci Resolve: Color grading
Premiere: Editing

[40-50s] SUPPORTING TOOLS
ChatGPT: Prompting, scripting, strategy
ElevenLabs: Voiceover
Figma: Design assembly
Notion: Project management

[50-58s] THE MONTHLY COST
~$200/month for everything.
That's it.

[58-62s] CTA
Comment "STACK" and I'll send you the full stack with links.
```

## DAY 53: "Forget Your Job (The Slow Parts)"
**Hook Type:** ohneis652's hook style
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "AUTOMATE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Forget your job.
Or at least, the slow parts of it.

[3-12s] CONTEXT
I used to spend 60% of my time on:
- Research and reference gathering
- Asset creation and sourcing
- Revisions and variations

Now AI does all of that.

[12-22s] WHAT'S LEFT
The 40% that matters:
- Strategy
- Creative direction
- Client relationships
- Big picture thinking

[22-38s] THE LEVERAGE
Same output. 60% less time.
Which means:
- More clients with same hours
- Same clients with less stress
- Or just... more life

[38-48s] THE REFRAME
AI isn't replacing my job.
It's removing the parts I never liked anyway.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "AUTOMATE" and I'll send you my automation map.
```

---

## DAY 54: "The Death of the Middle"
**Hook Type:** Industry Take
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "MIDDLE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
AI is killing the middle.
And that's where most people are stuck.

[3-12s] THE OLD SPECTRUM
Low-end: Cheap, fast, low quality
Mid-tier: Moderate price, decent quality
High-end: Expensive, slow, premium

[12-22s] WHAT AI CHANGED
AI makes mid-tier quality cheap and instant.
Which means mid-tier service is worthless.

Why pay $5K for decent when AI gives you decent for $50?

[22-38s] WHERE TO BE
You have two options now:

1. GO HIGH-END: Strategy, relationships, white-glove service.
Things AI can't do. Charge premium.

2. GO VOLUME: Use AI for speed.
Serve more clients faster. Lower prices, higher volume.

[38-50s] THE DEATH ZONE
The middle—decent work at decent prices—is dead.
There's no moat there anymore.

Pick a direction.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "MIDDLE" and I'll send you my positioning framework.
```

## DAY 55: "Product Ads in 10 Minutes"
**Hook Type:** Speed Reveal
**Duration:** 48s
**CTA Trigger:** "10MIN"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Full product ad in 10 minutes.
I timed it.

[3-10s] MINUTE 1-2: CONCEPT
ChatGPT: "Give me 3 ad concepts for [product]."
Pick the best one.
Done.

[10-18s] MINUTE 3-5: VISUALS
Midjourney: Generate 4 product shots.
Pick 2 winners.
Send to Nano Banana for motion.

[18-28s] MINUTE 6-8: ASSEMBLY
Premiere: Drop clips in timeline.
Add text overlays.
Basic transitions.

[28-38s] MINUTE 9-10: POLISH
Quick color adjustment.
Add music from library.
Export.

[38-45s] THE RESULT
Not perfect. But good enough to test.
Run it. See what works. Iterate on winners.

[45-52s] CTA
Comment "10MIN" and I'll send you the 10-minute checklist.
```

# WEEK 9: FUTURE-PROOFING

---

## DAY 56: "What Happens When Everyone Can Do This?"
**Hook Type:** Philosophical
**Duration:** 58s
**CTA Trigger:** "NEXT"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
What happens when everyone can make AI content?

[4-12s] THE CURRENT EDGE
Right now, knowing these tools is an advantage.
Most people don't.
We're early.

[12-22s] THE INEVITABLE
In 12-18 months, everyone will know.
The tools will be easier.
The tutorials will be everywhere.
The advantage disappears.

[22-38s] WHAT REMAINS
When creation is commoditized:
- TASTE becomes the differentiator
- SPEED becomes the advantage
- STRATEGY becomes the moat
- RELATIONSHIPS become everything

[38-50s] THE PLAY
Learn the tools NOW while they're an edge.
But build the skills that WON'T be commoditized:
- Creative direction
- Brand strategy
- Client relationships
- Taste cultivation

[50-60s] CTA
Comment "NEXT" and I'll send you my future-proof skill roadmap.
```

## DAY 57: "AI Won't Replace You—But..."
**Hook Type:** Philosophical
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "REPLACE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
AI won't replace you.
Someone using AI will replace you.

[3-12s] THE CLICHE REFRAME
You've heard this a million times.
But have you ACTED on it?

[12-22s] THE REALITY
Right now, in your industry:
Someone is learning these tools.
Someone is building with them.
Someone is getting faster.

While you're "waiting to see how it plays out."

[22-38s] THE CHOICE
You can:
A) Pretend it's not happening
B) Experiment casually
C) Go all in

Most people are at A or B.
The winners are at C.

[38-48s] THE TIMELINE
We're maybe 2 years from mainstream adoption.
That's your window.
Use it or get lapped.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "REPLACE" and I'll send you the 30-day catch-up plan.
```

## DAY 58: "The Tools I'm Watching for 2026"
**Hook Type:** Trend Preview
**Duration:** 55s
**CTA Trigger:** "2026"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
These are the tools that'll matter in 2026.
Get ahead now.

[3-15s] VIDEO: VIDU 2.0
The consistency is insane.
Characters stay the same across scenes.
This is what we've been waiting for.

[15-27s] 3D: MESHY AND TRIPO
Text-to-3D is finally usable.
Product mockups. Environment assets.
3D content without 3D skills.

[27-40s] AUDIO: UDIO AND SUNO
Music generation is solved.
Custom soundtracks on demand.
No more licensing headaches.

[40-50s] AUTOMATION: AGENT WORKFLOWS
AI that chains tools together.
"Create an ad" and it handles everything.
We're almost there.

[50-58s] CTA
Comment "2026" and I'll send you my tools watchlist.
```

## DAY 59: "Build the Audience Before the Product"
**Hook Type:** Strategy
**Duration:** 52s
**CTA Trigger:** "AUDIENCE"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-3s] HOOK
Build the audience before the product.
Not after.

[3-12s] THE OLD WAY
Make product → Launch → Find customers → Hope

The new way:
Build audience → Learn what they want → Make that → Sell

[12-22s] WHY IT WORKS
When you have an audience:
- You know exactly what to build
- You have customers waiting
- You can test ideas before committing
- Launches are warm, not cold

[22-38s] HOW AI HELPS
You can "fake" a brand to build an audience.
Test concepts with AI visuals.
See what resonates.
THEN produce.

[38-48s] EXAMPLE
I built a following for a brand that didn't exist.
When I launched the actual product,
500 people bought day one.
Because they'd been waiting.

[48-55s] CTA
Comment "AUDIENCE" and I'll send you my pre-launch playbook.
```

## DAY 60: "This Is Just the Beginning"
**Hook Type:** Closing Manifesto
**Duration:** 60s
**CTA Trigger:** "BEGIN"

### SCRIPT:

```
[0-4s] HOOK
We're at the beginning.
Not the middle. Not the peak.
The very start.

[4-15s] WHERE WE ARE
Image generation: 3 years old
Video generation: 1 year old
3D generation: 6 months old

This is the worst these tools will ever be.
And they're already incredible.

[15-28s] WHAT'S COMING
Consistent characters across hours of video.
Real-time generation.
Voice and video in one model.
AI that plans entire campaigns.

We're 2-3 years away from all of this.

[28-42s] THE OPPORTUNITY
Right now, you can learn these tools.
Get good. Build a reputation.
Become the person others hire.

When mainstream adoption hits,
you won't be learning—you'll be leading.

[42-52s] THE CHOICE
This is the best time to start.
Low competition. High ceiling.
The window is open.

[52-60s] FINAL CTA
Comment "BEGIN" and I'll send you everything—
all 60 days of resources in one package.
Let's build.
```
