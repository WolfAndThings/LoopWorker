# LOOPWORKER IMAGE PROMPTS
## Visuals Matched to Each Video Script

---

## THE AESTHETIC: RAW, NOT PERFECT

**CRITICAL:** Don't make typical "AI perfect" images. Your look is:
- Hard flash / direct lighting
- Dutch tilt / off-angle framing
- Film grain and texture
- Imperfect, off-center composition
- Editorial rawness, not stock polish

---

## THE ENERGY: SOMETHING HAPPENS

**CRITICAL #2:** Every image needs IMPLIED NARRATIVE. Not products sitting there. STORY.

**Ask yourself:** What just happened? What's about to happen?

**Good energy:**
- ✅ Hands mid-action (grabbing, applying, pouring)
- ✅ Motion blur on movement
- ✅ Caught in the moment (not posed)
- ✅ Chaos visible (multiple items, process mess)
- ✅ Screen showing prompts/tools (the work)
- ✅ Before/after in same frame
- ✅ Reaction moment (discovery, reveal)

**Dead energy:**
- ❌ Product alone on surface, nothing happening
- ❌ Perfectly arranged, no story
- ❌ Static, posed, waiting
- ❌ Just the output, not the process

---

## ADD TO EVERY PROMPT:
```
, hard flash photography, slight dutch tilt, film grain, off-center composition, caught mid-action, something happening, raw editorial style, decisive moment, shot on 35mm --s 100
```

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Perfectly centered subjects
- ❌ Soft dreamy lighting
- ❌ Smooth airbrushed skin
- ❌ Symmetrical compositions
- ❌ That typical "AI glow"
- ❌ Static product shots with nothing happening

# HOW TO ADD "SOMETHING HAPPENS" TO ANY PROMPT

## The Formula:
**[Subject] + [Action verb happening NOW] + [Evidence of process] + [Context showing work]**

## Before → After Examples:

**DEAD:** "Coffee cup on marble surface"
**ALIVE:** "Hand just set coffee cup down, steam rising, laptop with Midjourney visible in background, other cups being styled around it"

**DEAD:** "Skincare products arranged on shelf"
**ALIVE:** "Hand reaching to grab serum bottle, other products knocked slightly askew from the motion, bathroom mirror showing person in reflection"

**DEAD:** "Fashion lookbook photo of model"
**ALIVE:** "Model mid-turn, fabric swinging from the movement, stylist's hand visible at edge adjusting something, behind-the-scenes energy"

**DEAD:** "Perfume bottle with petals"
**ALIVE:** "Perfume bottle just placed, liquid still rippling, petals disturbed and floating from the impact"

## Action Verbs That Work:
- "just placed"
- "mid-motion"
- "about to"
- "caught the moment of"
- "reaching for"
- "pulling away"
- "turning"
- "setting up"
- "arranging"
- "reacting to"

## Context That Shows Process:
- "laptop screen visible showing [tool]"
- "other iterations scattered nearby"
- "behind-the-scenes chaos"
- "in the middle of the shoot"
- "setup in progress"
- "workspace visible"

---

---

# ADVANCED PROMPT TECHNIQUES

## 1. SPECIFIC NUMBERS (Creates Believability)
From the viral content playbook: specificity = authenticity

**Instead of:** "coffee bags on table"
**Use:** "4 coffee bags, one torn open with beans spilling out, receipt showing $127 visible at edge of frame"

**Instead of:** "skincare products"
**Use:** "7 iterations of the same serum bottle, some upside down, sticky notes with version numbers, v3 circled"

## 2. SHOW THE TOOLS (Proves You Did The Work)
```
, laptop screen visible showing Midjourney /imagine prompt, Discord interface partially visible
```
```
, phone in hand showing Instagram feed of the fake brand, notifications visible
```
```
, Notion page open in background with brand brief, color swatches taped to wall
```

## 3. THE "CHAOS OF ITERATION" (Shows Process)
```
, rejected generations crumpled nearby, multiple print tests scattered, the mess of creative work
```
```
, 20+ thumbnail variations visible on screen, cursor hovering over the winner
```
```
, color swatches taped to monitor, reference images pinned to corkboard behind
```

## 4. SPECIFIC PHOTOGRAPHER/DIRECTOR REFERENCES
These give instant style direction:

**For raw editorial:** "shot by Terry Richardson, direct flash, raw and unflattering"
**For moody luxury:** "shot by Peter Lindbergh, black and white, intimate"
**For chaotic energy:** "shot by David LaChapelle, hypercolor, maximalist"
**For minimal product:** "shot by Juergen Teller, casual imperfection, anti-gloss"
**For food/lifestyle:** "shot by Wolfgang Tillmans, everyday beauty, candid"

## 5. TIME/LIGHT SPECIFICITY (Creates Mood)
```
, 3am energy, laptop glow the only light source, red bull can empty
```
```
, golden hour through dirty window, dust particles visible in light beam
```
```
, harsh noon sun through blinds, overexposed stripe shadows
```
```
, fluorescent office lighting, unflattering but real
```

## 6. MATERIALITY KEYWORDS (Tactile Texture)
Add these for that "you can feel it" quality:
- "visible paper grain"
- "sticky fingerprint on glass"
- "condensation droplets"
- "worn leather patina"
- "fabric thread texture visible"
- "dust on surface"
- "water ring stain from coffee cup"

## 7. THE "CAUGHT YOU" FEELING
Make it feel like the viewer stumbled into something:
```
, as if photographer just walked in, person mid-turn looking up
```
```
, security camera aesthetic, timestamp visible, surveillance angle
```
```
, mirror selfie energy, phone visible in reflection
```

## 8. CROP/FRAMING IMPERFECTION
```
, cropped awkwardly at the elbow, intentional amateur framing
```
```
, subject at extreme edge of frame, negative space tension
```
```
, shot from below looking up, unflattering angle
```
```
, half the face cut off by frame edge, intimate crop
```

## 9. COLOR PALETTE CONSTRAINTS
Force cohesion by limiting color:
```
, muted earth tones only, desaturated except for one red element
```
```
, blue hour color palette, everything cold except warm skin tones
```
```
, two-tone aesthetic, only black white and one accent color
```

## 10. THE "EVIDENCE" SHOT (Shows Receipts)
```
, calculator app open showing total, credit card nearby
```
```
, shipping labels scattered, order confirmations printed
```
```
, analytics dashboard visible on screen showing growth
```
```
, DM notifications flooding in, phone screen cracked but working
```

☐ **Tactile texture?** (can I feel it)
☐ **Imperfect framing?** (not centered/perfect)
☐ **Photographer reference?** (instant style)
☐ **Low stylization?** (--s 50-100, not 250+)

If you can't check at least 5, revise the prompt.
