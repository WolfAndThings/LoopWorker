# LOOPWORKER DUAL FORMAT STRATEGY
## Video + Carousel Content Plan

---

## TWO LANES, ONE NICHE

You have two content formats that work differently with the algorithm:

| Format | Best For | Engagement Type | Effort |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Video** | Virality, personality, hooks | Watch time, follows | High |
| **Carousel** | Saves, shares, reference | Saves, shares | Medium |

**The play:** Use both strategically. They feed each other.

---

## HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

```
VIDEO: Hooks attention, builds personality, drives follows
   ↓
CAROUSEL: Deepens value, drives saves, becomes reference material
   ↓
SAVED CAROUSEL: Algorithm shows you to same person again
   ↓
MORE VIDEOS: They're now a warm follower
   ↓
REPEAT
```

# VIDEO CONTENT STRATEGY

## What Videos Are For:
- Hook and capture attention
- Show your face/voice (builds trust)
- Demonstrate real-time process
- Create viral moments
- Personality + authority building

## Video Content Types:
1. **Brand Reveals** - "I built a fake X brand"
2. **Tool Announcements** - "X just dropped and it changes everything"
3. **Workflow Timelapses** - "Watch me build X in 90 seconds"
4. **Hot Takes** - "Your X sucks" (Phase 3)
5. **Impossible Shots** - "This photo can't exist in real life"

## Video Specs:
- Duration: 45-60 seconds
- Aspect: 9:16 (vertical)
- Hook: First 3 seconds
- Face time: 20% minimum
- Output on screen: 70%

# CAROUSEL CONTENT STRATEGY

## What Carousels Are For:
- Reference material people SAVE
- Prompt templates they screenshot
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Step-by-step breakdowns
- "Swipe to learn" education

## Carousel Types That WORK:

### Type 1: Prompt Template (HIGHEST SAVES)
```
Slide 1: "The exact prompt for [aesthetic] photography"
Slide 2: Full prompt text (screenshot-able)
Slide 3: Example output 1
Slide 4: Example output 2
Slide 5: "Save this. You'll need it."
```

### Type 2: Before/After Comparison
```
Slide 1: "Same subject. Different prompt structure."
Slide 2: Bad prompt → Bad result
Slide 3: Good prompt → Good result
Slide 4: The difference explained
Slide 5: "Share with someone who needs this."
```

### Type 3: Prompt Breakdown
```
Slide 1: "Why this image works (and yours doesn't)"
Slide 2: The final image
Slide 3: Subject breakdown
Slide 4: Style breakdown
Slide 5: Technical breakdown
Slide 6: Full prompt revealed
Slide 7: "Drop a 🔥 if you want more like this"
```

### Type 4: Tool Comparison
```
Slide 1: "Midjourney vs Flux vs DALL-E 3"
Slide 2: Same prompt - Midjourney result
Slide 3: Same prompt - Flux result
Slide 4: Same prompt - DALL-E result
Slide 5: Verdict + when to use each
```

### Type 5: Style Guide
```
Slide 1: "How to get [specific aesthetic] in AI"
Slide 2-6: Different examples of that aesthetic
Slide 7: The prompt patterns they all share
Slide 8: "Save this style guide"
```

---

## CAROUSEL SPECS

- Slides: 5-10 (sweet spot is 7)
- Aspect: 4:5 or 1:1 (Instagram)
- Font: Clean, readable, high contrast
- First slide: Bold hook, clear value proposition
- Last slide: CTA (save, share, comment)
