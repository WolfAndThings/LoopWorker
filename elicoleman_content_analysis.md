**Why it works:** Creates cognitive dissonance, makes viewer re-examine visuals

### 4. "What if" Pattern

3. "Comment 'Studio' and I'll send you the complete guide"
4. "Comment 'send it' if you want this prompt"

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR STRATEGY

1. **Lead with the build, not the tool** - "I built X" outperforms "AI can do X"
2. **Create fake brands** - Complete brand identities get massive engagement
3. **Comment bait works** - "Comment [word] for prompt" drives huge comment volume
4. **Show the limitation, then the solution** - "This used to fail... now it doesn't"
5. **Tangible results > abstract tips** - Show the cafe, the run club, the restaurant
6. **Cross-post works** - Same content performs well on both platforms
