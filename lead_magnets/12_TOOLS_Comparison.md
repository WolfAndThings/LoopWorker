## PROMPT TRANSLATION

Same concept, different tools:

### ChatGPT Style
```
Create a product photo of a ceramic coffee mug. Style it like a high-end catalog shot - clean white background, soft shadows, the kind of lighting that makes it look expensive. The mug should be matte sage green with a slightly imperfect handmade quality.
```

### Midjourney Style
```
ceramic coffee mug, sage green matte finish, handmade quality, product photography, white background, soft diffused lighting, catalog style, high-end --ar 4:5 --style raw --sref [code]
```

### Flux Style
```
Professional product photograph of a ceramic coffee mug, sage green matte glaze with slight handmade imperfections, centered on pure white cyclorama, soft diffused studio lighting from above left, subtle shadows, shot on 100mm macro lens, f/11, commercial catalog style, 4:5 aspect ratio
```
