# Coffee Shop — Raw Flash Style
## 10 Shots. Gritty. Analog. Editorial.

---

## THE LOOK

Every image in this pack follows one style:
- **Flash photography** — harsh, direct, on-camera flash
- **35mm film grain** — visible noise, not clean digital
- **Harsh shadows** — hard edges, not soft diffused
- **Raw and gritty** — imperfect, textured, real
- **Analog aesthetic** — Kodak, Fuji, disposable camera vibes
- **Editorial but accessible** — magazine quality, street energy

## STYLE LOCK

Use this at the start of your ChatGPT session:

```
For all images in this session, use this exact style: On-camera flash photography with harsh shadows. 35mm film aesthetic with visible grain and noise. Raw, gritty, analog look. Colors slightly muted and nostalgic. Imperfect but intentional — not polished or airbrushed. Think disposable camera meets editorial magazine.
```

## 1. THE BARISTA — FLASH PORTRAIT

```

Avoid: Soft lighting, clean digital look, posed smile, retouched skin

## 4. THE FINISHED DRINK — TABLE FLASH

```

Avoid: Styled flat lay, soft window light, perfect composition

```
Wide shot of espresso station during rush. Two portafilters locked in machine, shots pulling. Direct flash illuminating steam and chaos. Multiple cups, spilled grounds, used towels. Barista's torso and hands blur-moving through frame.

35mm grain, flash reflecting off chrome. Motion blur on barista, sharp on machine. The energy of service, not a staged moment.

Avoid: Clean organized counter, posed setup, soft ambient light

```
Woman's hands wrapped around coffee cup at table, shot from across table. Direct flash catching hands and cup, face out of frame. Chipped nail polish visible, real hands. Worn table surface, scratched and stained.

35mm grain, warm flash tones. Not a lifestyle moment — a real moment caught.

Style: Flash candid, real hands, grain, imperfect details
Avoid: Model hands, soft window light, aspirational lifestyle

## 9. THE BAG — PRODUCT FLASH

```
Single kraft coffee bag on concrete surface. Direct flash, hard shadow behind bag. Simple hand-stamped label, slightly crooked. Few beans scattered, not arranged. Industrial setting, not styled.

## 10. THE CLOSE — END OF DAY

```
Empty espresso machine at close, portafilters removed and resting on drain tray. Direct flash, harsh shadows, no ambient light. Wet surfaces reflecting flash. Cleaned but showing wear — scratches, patina, use.

35mm grain, slightly underexposed. The quiet after rush. Not glamorous — just real.

Style: Flash documentary, empty space, grain, worn surfaces
Avoid: Golden hour, soft light, romanticized closing time
