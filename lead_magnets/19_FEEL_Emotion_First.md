# THE EMOTION-FIRST PROMPT GUIDE
## Stop Describing What You See. Start Describing What You Feel.

---

## THE SHIFT

**Old way:** Describe what you want to SEE
"A woman in a red dress walking through a field at sunset"

**New way:** Describe what you want to FEEL
"Golden hour warmth, nostalgic summer evening, analog film texture, emotional distance"

Same scene. Completely different result.

## WHY EMOTION FIRST

### The Problem with Visual-First
When you describe visuals:
- AI interprets literally
- Results are generic
- No emotional resonance
- Looks like stock photography

### The Power of Emotion-First
When you lead with feeling:
- AI captures intention
- Results have mood
- Images resonate
- Looks like art direction

## THE EMOTION STACK

Layer emotions for complexity:

### Primary + Secondary
"Nostalgic (primary) with melancholic undertones (secondary)"
- Primary sets the main mood
- Secondary adds depth

### Tension Pairs
Combine contrasting emotions:
- "Bold yet intimate"
- "Sophisticated but raw"
- "Joyful with mystery"

This creates visual tension that makes images interesting.
