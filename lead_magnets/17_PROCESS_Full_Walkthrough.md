# THE FULL PROCESS WALKTHROUGH
## From Zero to Finished Brand (No Gatekeeping)

---

## THE 6-STEP PROCESS

1. Define the feeling
2. Collect references
3. Extract keywords
4. Build the prompt template
5. Generate and curate
6. Package and present

---

## STEP 1: DEFINE THE FEELING

### The Question
"What emotion should someone feel when they experience this brand?"

### The Exercise
Write down 5 emotional words. Not visual words—emotional words.

**Examples:**
- Warm, nostalgic, intimate, authentic, crafted
- Bold, confident, rebellious, urban, raw
- Calm, minimal, sophisticated, serene, elevated
- Energetic, playful, vibrant, joyful, dynamic

### Common Mistakes
❌ Starting with visuals ("I want blue and white")
✅ Starting with feelings ("I want calm sophistication")

---

## STEP 2: COLLECT REFERENCES

### The Goal
Find 10-15 images that capture your emotional target.

### Where to Look
- Pinterest (search your emotion words)
- Are.na (curated, taste-forward)
- Film stills (strong emotional direction)
- Magazine archives (editorial quality)
- Competitor brands (what works in category)
- Art photography (pure aesthetic)

### What to Collect
- NOT what you want to create
- What FEELS like what you want to create
- Mix of sources and subjects
- United by emotional quality

### Organization
Create a folder or board. Include:
- The image
- Why you saved it
- What specifically you like

---

## STEP 3: EXTRACT KEYWORDS

### The Method
Look at your references and identify patterns.

### Categories to Extract

**Lighting:**
- What direction? (side, window, overhead)
- What quality? (soft, harsh, diffused)
- What time of day? (morning, golden hour, blue hour)

**Color:**
- What palette? (specific colors)
- What temperature? (warm, cool, neutral)
- What saturation? (muted, vibrant, desaturated)

**Texture:**
- What surfaces? (marble, wood, fabric)
- What qualities? (smooth, rough, worn)
- What imperfections? (grain, scratches, wear)

**Composition:**
- What framing? (close, wide, medium)
- What depth? (shallow, deep)
- What angle? (eye level, above, below)

**Mood:**
- What atmosphere? (intimate, grand, quiet)
- What energy? (calm, dynamic, tense)

### The Output
A list of specific, usable descriptors.

**Example:**
"Soft window light from left, warm color grade, 35mm film grain, muted earth tones (cream, sage, coffee), shallow depth of field, worn wood surfaces, visible texture, intimate close-ups"

---

## STEP 4: BUILD THE PROMPT TEMPLATE

### The Structure
```
[Emotional quality]. [Photography style], [lighting setup]. [SCENE PLACEHOLDER]. [Color palette]. [Texture elements]. [Technical specs].
```

### Filling It In

**From your keywords:**
- Emotional quality: "Intimate artisanal warmth"
- Photography style: "35mm film aesthetic with visible grain"
- Lighting: "Soft window light from left"
- Color: "Muted earth tones - cream, sage, warm brown"
- Texture: "Worn surfaces, natural materials, imperfect"
- Technical: "Shot on 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, 4:5 ratio"

### The Template
```
Intimate artisanal warmth. 35mm film aesthetic with visible grain, soft window light from left. [SPECIFIC SCENE]. Muted earth tones - cream, sage, warm brown. Worn surfaces, natural materials, imperfect textures. Shot on 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, 4:5 ratio.
```

Now every image uses this template with different [SPECIFIC SCENE].

---

## STEP 5: GENERATE AND CURATE

### The Volume Approach
- Generate 10 images per scene
- Pick best 2-3
- Refine if needed
- Move to next scene

### The Scenes
Map what images your brand needs:
1. Hero/signature shot
2. Product shots (various angles)
3. Lifestyle/context shots
4. Detail/texture shots
5. Environmental shots
6. Social content

### The Curation Process

**First Pass:** Quick gut reaction
- Yes (definitely use)
- Maybe (review later)
- No (delete)

**Second Pass:** Technical check
- Is the lighting consistent?
- Are there AI artifacts?
- Does it match the brand?

**Third Pass:** Final selection
- Pick the best
- Ensure variety
- Check cohesion

### When to Refine
If none of 10 work:
- Adjust the prompt
- Try different approach
- Regenerate

If close but not perfect:
- Use follow-up prompts
- "Make the lighting warmer"
- "Add more texture"
