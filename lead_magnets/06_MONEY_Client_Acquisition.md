## THE TRUTH ABOUT FINDING CLIENTS

**Stop looking for clients. Start attracting them.**

The creators making $5K-20K/month from AI aren't cold messaging. They're:
1. Solving problems publicly
2. Showing proof of work
3. Being visible where buyers are

---

## THE ATTRACTION SYSTEM

### Step 1: Build Proof of Work
Create 5-10 complete brand concepts. Each should include:
- Logo/identity concept
- 10-15 cohesive images
- Social content examples
- Mockups showing real-world application

**Key:** These are fake brands, but they prove you can execute.

### Step 2: Post the Process
Document how you built them:
- Before/after transformations
- Prompt breakdowns
- Behind-the-scenes process
- Time-lapse of creation

**Key:** Process content attracts clients who want that process applied to their brand.

### Step 3: Be Visible in the Right Places
Where brand owners and marketers hang out:
- LinkedIn (B2B, agency, startup founders)
- Instagram (DTC brands, lifestyle, beauty)
- Twitter/X (tech, startup, VC circles)
- TikTok (younger entrepreneurs, DTC)

## THE COLD OUTREACH TEMPLATE

I put together a quick concept for [Company Name]. No strings attached - just wanted to show you what's possible.

[Link to 3-5 AI-generated images styled for their brand]

If this resonates, I'd love to chat about how we could apply this to your upcoming campaigns.

Best,
[Your name]

**Why this works:**

**"I'm not sure AI can match our brand."**
"Totally fair concern. Let me create a quick test - 3 images in your brand style, no charge. If it doesn't match, no hard feelings. If it does, we move forward."
