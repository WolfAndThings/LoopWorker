1. **Start with the style lock** at the beginning of your session
2. **Reference previous images** — say "same style as the last one but..."
3. **Iterate** — if something's not right, say "more grease" or "messier"
4. **Be specific about the logo** — always mention "Beef Boy" by name
5. **Call out the flash** — "harsh on-camera flash with deep shadows"
