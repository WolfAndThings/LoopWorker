# Restaurant — Raw Flash Style
## 10 Shots. Gritty. Analog. Editorial.

---

## THE LOOK

Every image in this pack follows one style:
- **Flash photography** — harsh, direct, on-camera flash
- **35mm film grain** — visible noise, not clean digital
- **Harsh shadows** — hard edges, not soft diffused
- **Raw and gritty** — imperfect, textured, real
- **Analog aesthetic** — Kodak, Fuji, disposable camera vibes
- **Editorial but accessible** — magazine quality, street energy

---

## STYLE LOCK

```
For all images in this session, use this exact style: On-camera flash photography with harsh shadows. 35mm film aesthetic with visible grain and noise. Raw, gritty, analog look. Colors slightly muted and nostalgic. Imperfect but intentional — not polished or airbrushed. Think disposable camera meets editorial magazine.

## 1. THE DISH — FLASH FOOD

```

35mm grain, flash hotspot on fish skin. Not food-styled. Already being eaten.

Style: Flash food, harsh light, grain, mid-meal reality
Avoid: Soft styling light, perfect plating, untouched presentation

## 2. THE KITCHEN — LINE FLASH

```

## 3. THE CHEF — PORTRAIT FLASH

```
Head chef straight to camera, direct flash. White coat stained from service, sweat on forehead. Not smiling — intense, focused, tired. Kitchen chaos blurred behind. Arms at sides, not crossed.

35mm grain, flash on face showing skin texture, pores, real fatigue. Portrait of work, not PR.

Style: Flash portrait, harsh light, grain, real exhaustion
Avoid: Smiling chef, clean coat, soft lighting, crossed arms pose

## 4. THE TABLE — AFTERMATH FLASH

```
Table after dinner service, direct flash from above. Dirty plates, wine glasses with dregs, crumpled napkins. Dessert half-eaten. Candle burnt down to nub. Evidence of a good meal.

## 6. THE APPETIZER — SHARING FLASH

```
Charcuterie board on table, two hands reaching in from opposite sides grabbing items. Direct flash, harsh shadows of hands. Board already picked over — gaps, crumbs, empty spots. Wine glass knocked slightly askew.

35mm grain, flash on hands and food. Social eating, caught.

Style: Flash sharing moment, hands, grain, mid-meal

```
Chocolate lava cake cut open, molten center flowing out. Direct flash, harsh shadow on white plate. Ice cream melting into chocolate, pooling. Spoon in frame, chocolate on it. Plate edge smeared.

2. **Generate #1** — sets your baseline look

## THE DIFFERENCE

**Generic restaurant:** Soft light, perfect plating, empty tables

**This system:** Flash mid-service, food being eaten, the chaos

One looks like a Yelp photo. One looks like a real night out.
