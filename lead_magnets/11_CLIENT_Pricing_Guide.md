## THE PRICING CONVERSATION

### Discovery Questions
1. "What's the scope of this project?"
2. "What's your timeline?"
3. "How will these assets be used?"
4. "What does success look like?"
5. "What's your budget range for this?"

### Presenting Options
Always present 3 options:
- **Good:** Meets basic needs
- **Better:** Recommended, best value
- **Best:** Premium, comprehensive

This anchors the middle option and gives client control.

### Handling "Too Expensive"
1. "I understand. What's your budget?"
2. "We can adjust scope to fit. What's most important?"
3. "Let me show you what's included and why it's priced this way."
4. "What would make this a clear yes for you?"

## CALCULATING YOUR RATES

### Step 1: Know Your Costs
- Software subscriptions: $__/month

- Business expenses: $__/month
- Taxes (set aside 25-30%): $__/month

### Step 2: Know Your Time
- Actual billable hours available: __/month
- Time for marketing/admin: __/month

### Step 3: Set Income Goals
- Minimum needed: $__/month
- Target income: $__/month
