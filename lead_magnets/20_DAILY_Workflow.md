## THE RULES

### Rule 1: Content First
Before anything else, create content. It compounds.

### Rule 2: Deep Work Blocks
No notifications during focus time. Everything can wait 2 hours.

### Rule 3: Batch Everything
Group similar tasks. Context switching kills productivity.

### Rule 4: Energy Matching
Do hard things when you have energy. Don't force it.

### Rule 5: Protect the End
No work after 5 PM. Burnout is real.
