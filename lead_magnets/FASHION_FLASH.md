# Fashion Brand — Raw Flash Style
## 10 Shots. Gritty. Analog. Editorial.

---

## THE LOOK

Every image in this pack follows one style:
- **Flash photography** — harsh, direct, on-camera flash
- **35mm film grain** — visible noise, not clean digital
- **Harsh shadows** — hard edges, not soft diffused
- **Raw and gritty** — imperfect, textured, real
- **Analog aesthetic** — Kodak, Fuji, disposable camera vibes
- **Editorial but accessible** — magazine quality, street energy

---

## STYLE LOCK

```
For all images in this session, use this exact style: On-camera flash photography with harsh shadows. 35mm film aesthetic with visible grain and noise. Raw, gritty, analog look. Colors slightly muted and nostalgic. Imperfect but intentional — not polished or airbrushed. Think disposable camera meets editorial magazine.

```

---

## 8. THE PILE — PRODUCT FLASH

```
Pile of folded t-shirts on concrete surface, direct flash from above. Different colors — white, grey, black, navy. Not neatly stacked — shifted, imperfect pile. Tags visible on some.

## HOW TO USE

1. **Start session** with Style Lock prompt
2. **Generate #1** — sets your baseline look
3. **Each following prompt:** "Same flash style as before, but now showing: [next scene]"
4. **Iterate:** "More grain" / "Harsher flash" / "Dirtier sneakers"

---

## THE DIFFERENCE

**Generic fashion:** Soft light, perfect pose, aspirational lifestyle

**This system:** Flash at night, awkward stance, worn-in clothing

One looks like a catalog. One looks like a real brand with a point of view.
