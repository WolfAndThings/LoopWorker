## THE PHILOSOPHY

You're not making images.
You're building worlds.

A world has:
- Consistent rules
- Visual logic
- Emotional truth
- Infinite scalability

---

## THE 6-STEP SYSTEM

### Step 1: Define the Feeling
Before anything visual, answer:
- What emotion should this brand evoke?
- How should someone feel when they experience it?
- What's the energy?

**Exercise:** Write 3-5 emotional words.
Example: "Warm, nostalgic, intimate, authentic, crafted"

### Step 2: Gather References
Find 15-20 images that capture the feeling.
- Not what you want to make
- What captures the feeling
- Mix of sources (photography, art, film)

**Sources:**
- Pinterest
- Are.na
- Film stills
- Magazine archives
- Competitor brands

### Step 3: Extract the Visual Rules
From your references, identify:
- Lighting style
- Color palette
- Texture vocabulary
- Composition patterns
- Mood/atmosphere

**Exercise:** Write specific descriptors.
Example: "Soft window light, warm color grade, visible grain, muted earth tones, shallow depth of field"

### Step 4: Write the Master Prompt
Combine feeling + visual rules into one template.

**Structure:**
```
[Emotional quality]. [Photography style], [lighting]. [SPECIFIC SCENE]. [Color palette]. [Texture elements]. [Technical specs].
```

**Example:**
```
Intimate artisanal warmth. 35mm film aesthetic, soft window light from left. [SPECIFIC SCENE]. Muted earth tones - cream, sage, warm brown. Visible grain, natural textures, imperfect surfaces. Shot on 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, 4:5 ratio.
```

### Step 5: Map the Asset Needs
What images does a complete brand need?

**Core Assets:**
- Hero/signature image
- Product shots (5-10)
- Lifestyle/context (5-10)
- Detail close-ups (5-10)
- Environmental (3-5)
- Social content templates (5-10)

### Step 6: Batch Generate
Same master prompt, different scenes.
- Generate 10 per category
- Pick best 2-3
- Refine as needed
