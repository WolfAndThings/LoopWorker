# REALISTIC PORTRAIT PROMPT TEMPLATE
## Making AI Faces Look Human

---

## THE PROBLEM

Default AI faces look:
- Plastic, airbrushed
- Perfectly symmetrical
- Obviously fake
- "Uncanny valley"

We want faces that look:
- Textured, real
- Naturally imperfect
- Photographed, not rendered
- Human

---

## THE FIX: IMPERFECTION LANGUAGE

AI defaults to "perfect" because prompts ask for:
- Beautiful
- Flawless
- Perfect
- Stunning

Instead, ask for reality:
- Natural skin texture
- Visible pores
- Subtle asymmetry
- Real lighting with actual shadows
