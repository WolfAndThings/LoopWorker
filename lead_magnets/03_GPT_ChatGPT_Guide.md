# THE CHATGPT IMAGE GUIDE
## Why ChatGPT Beats Midjourney for Brand Work

---

## THE HONEST COMPARISON

| Aspect | ChatGPT | Midjourney |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Consistency | Excellent - follows direction | Variable - beautiful accidents |
| Control | High - does what you ask | Medium - interprets loosely |
| Realism | Very high | High (but stylized) |
| Speed | Fast | Fast |
| Best For | Brands, products, consistency | Art, exploration, mood |
| Learning Curve | Low | Medium |

**Bottom line:** ChatGPT for brand work. Midjourney for art exploration.

## CHATGPT IMAGE SETUP

### Getting Started
1. Open ChatGPT (Plus or Team subscription required)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Simply describe what you want
4. Iterate and refine

### Key Advantage
ChatGPT remembers your conversation. You can say:
- "Make it warmer"
- "Same style, different subject"
- "Keep the lighting, change the background"

Midjourney can't do this. Each prompt is isolated.

## CHATGPT PROMPTING BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Be Conversational
ChatGPT understands natural language better than keyword strings.

**Instead of:**
> "professional product photography, studio lighting, 8K, masterpiece, hyper-realistic"

**Try:**
> "I need a product photo of a ceramic coffee mug. Style it like a high-end catalog shot - clean white background, soft shadows, the kind of lighting that makes it look expensive. The mug should be a matte sage green color."

### 2. Iterate in Conversation
First prompt: Generate base concept
Second prompt: "Make the lighting softer"
Third prompt: "Add a subtle steam rising from the cup"
Fourth prompt: "Perfect. Now same style but in terracotta color"

### 3. Reference Styles Directly
ChatGPT knows photography references:

> "Shoot this like Annie Leibovitz would - dramatic side lighting, intimate but powerful"

> "Give me that Wes Anderson aesthetic - symmetrical, pastel palette, slightly surreal"

> "Style like a 1970s Kodachrome vacation photo - slightly faded, warm tones"

## MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY

### Method 1: Style Anchors
Start each prompt with your established style:

> "Continuing with our established brand style (warm 35mm film aesthetic, soft window lighting, muted earth tones)..."

### Method 2: Reference Previous Images
> "Using the same visual approach as the previous image, now create..."

### Method 3: Create a Brand Brief First
Tell ChatGPT your brand guidelines upfront:

> "I'm creating images for a brand with these characteristics:
> - Photography style: 35mm film, slight grain
> - Color palette: Warm earth tones, muted sage, cream
> - Lighting: Always soft, natural, directional
> - Mood: Nostalgic, intimate, handcrafted
> 
> Keep these consistent across all images I request."

## GETTING REALISTIC FACES

### The Problem
Default AI faces look plastic and perfect = obviously fake.

### The Fix
Add imperfection language:

```
Portrait should have:
- Visible skin texture and natural pores
- Slight asymmetry in features
- Natural expression (not posed smile)
- Real lighting with actual shadows
- Subtle imperfections that make it human

Avoid: Airbrushed, perfect, flawless, smooth, symmetrical
```

---

## GETTING REALISTIC PRODUCTS

### The Problem
Products look like 3D renders instead of photographs.

### The Fix
Add physical reality cues:

```
Product should show:
- Realistic material response to light
- Subtle surface imperfections
- Environmental reflections
- Proper shadows (soft, grounded)
- Context that grounds it in reality

Avoid: Floating, perfect, isolated, pristine
```
