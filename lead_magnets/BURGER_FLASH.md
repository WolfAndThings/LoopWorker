# Burger Joint — Raw Flash Style
## 10 Shots. Gritty. Analog. Editorial.

---

## THE LOOK

Every image in this pack follows one style:
- **Flash photography** — harsh, direct, on-camera flash
- **35mm film grain** — visible noise, not clean digital
- **Harsh shadows** — hard edges, not soft diffused
- **Raw and gritty** — imperfect, textured, real
- **Analog aesthetic** — Kodak, Fuji, disposable camera vibes
- **Editorial but accessible** — magazine quality, street energy

---

## STYLE LOCK

```
For all images in this session, use this exact style: On-camera flash photography with harsh shadows. 35mm film aesthetic with visible grain and noise. Raw, gritty, analog look. Colors slightly muted and nostalgic. Imperfect but intentional — not polished or airbrushed. Think disposable camera meets editorial magazine.
