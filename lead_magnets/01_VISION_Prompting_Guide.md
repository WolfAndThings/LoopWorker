# THE LOOPWORKER PROMPTING GUIDE
## From Idea to Full Brand in One Weekend

## THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**You're not prompting. You're art directing.**

The difference between amateur AI images and professional ones isn't the tool. It's the thinking behind the prompt.

---

## THE 5-LAYER PROMPT STRUCTURE

Every professional prompt has 5 layers:

### Layer 1: THE FEELING
What emotion should this evoke?
- Nostalgic, warm, intimate
- Bold, energetic, urgent
- Calm, minimal, sophisticated
- Raw, gritty, authentic

**Example:** "nostalgic warmth of a Sunday morning"

### Layer 2: THE STYLE
What does this look like technically?
- 35mm film grain, warm highlights
- Editorial flash photography
- Soft natural window light
- High contrast, deep shadows

**Example:** "35mm film aesthetic, warm color grade, visible grain"

### Layer 3: THE SUBJECT
What's actually in the frame?
- Be specific about position, action, expression
- Include environmental context
- Describe relationships between elements

**Example:** "barista's hands tamping espresso, steam rising, worn wooden counter"

### Layer 4: THE DETAILS
What makes this feel real?
- Imperfections, texture, wear
- Specific materials and surfaces
- Environmental storytelling elements

**Example:** "scratched countertop, coffee ring stains, morning light through dusty window"

### Layer 5: THE TECHNICAL
Camera/render specifications
- Aspect ratio
- Depth of field
- Lens characteristics

**Example:** "shot on 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, 3:4 aspect ratio"

## THE CONSISTENCY SYSTEM

To maintain brand consistency across multiple images:

### 1. Create a Style Bible
Document these for your brand:
- Primary lighting direction
- Color palette (specific tones)
- Texture vocabulary
- Camera/lens specs
- Recurring environmental elements

### 2. Reference Previous Outputs
Include in prompts:
- "Maintaining the same warm color grade as previous images"
- "Same lighting setup: soft window light from left"
- "Consistent with established brand aesthetic"

### 3. Use Seed References
When you get an image you love:
- Note what worked
- Extract the key descriptors
- Build a template from it

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Adjective Stacking
**Wrong:** "Beautiful, stunning, amazing, gorgeous, perfect"
**Right:** Specific descriptors that add information

### Mistake 2: Vague Lighting
**Wrong:** "Good lighting" or "professional lighting"
**Right:** "Soft diffused light from upper left, deep shadows on right side"

### Mistake 3: Generic Subjects
**Wrong:** "A woman holding a product"
**Right:** "Woman's hands (visible texture, short natural nails) cradling ceramic jar, fingertips pressing into matte surface"

### Mistake 4: Missing Imperfections
**Wrong:** "Perfect, flawless, clean"
**Right:** "Slight skin texture, natural pores, asymmetrical composition"

### Mistake 5: No Emotional Anchor
**Wrong:** Starting with the subject
**Right:** Starting with the feeling you want to evoke
