## HOW TO USE IN CHATGPT

### First Generation
1. Copy prompt #1 (Hero Shot)
2. Paste into ChatGPT
3. Generate image
4. If you like it → this is your style reference

### Building the Rest
Once you have your hero:

```
"Generate an image in the exact same style as the previous image, but this time showing: [paste next prompt]"
```

This keeps your brand consistent.

### Iteration
If something's off:
- "Make the lighting warmer"
- "Add more film grain"
- "Make the shadows softer"
- "Less perfect, more documentary feel"

---

## THE STYLE LOCK

After your first good image, tell ChatGPT:

```
"For all remaining images in this conversation, maintain this exact visual style: 35mm film aesthetic, warm Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, natural imperfections, documentary feel. Do not deviate from this look."
```

Now every image matches.
