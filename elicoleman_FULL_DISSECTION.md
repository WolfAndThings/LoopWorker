## HOOK FORMULA BREAKDOWN

### Formula 1: "I BUILT X" (Highest Performer)
**Pattern:** Personal achievement + tangible output + AI tool

**Examples:**
- "I built a full run club brand using nothing but AI and a clear visual direction"
- "I built a matcha brand called Made for Monty in a few hours"
- "I designed this from scratch"
- "I put together a full set of prompts"

**Why it works:**
- First-person authority ("I built")
- Concrete deliverable (brand, campaign, system)
- Implies teachable process
- Creates envy → "I want to do that too"

**Template:** `I built [tangible thing] using [simple method] in [short timeframe]`

---

### Formula 2: "THIS IS WHERE X USED TO FAIL" (Problem-Solution)
**Pattern:** Acknowledge past limitation → reveal breakthrough

**Examples:**
- "This is where image generation used to fall apart. Extreme close-ups. Skin. Texture."
- "Older models smoothed everything into plastic and broke the illusion"
- "Most AI fashion visuals look impressive at first, but they fall apart the moment you try to use them consistently"

**Why it works:**
- Validates viewer's past frustration
- Positions creator as someone who solved it
- Creates "before/after" narrative arc
- Implies insider knowledge

**Template:** `This is where [tool] used to fail. [Specific problem]. [New solution] doesn't do that.`

---

### Formula 3: "X ISN'T REAL" (Reality Reveal)
**Pattern:** Show impressive result → reveal it's fake → offer the method

**Examples:**
- "Smash Burger isn't a real restaurant, it's a brand identity I designed from scratch"
- "This brand, Montée, doesn't exist. But from the logo to the stitching on the rain jacket, it feels like it does"
- "None of these campaigns are real. But they could've been"

**Why it works:**
- Cognitive dissonance (looks real → told it's fake)
- Forces viewer to re-examine the visual
- Proves the tool's power through deception
- Implies viewer could do the same

**Template:** `[Brand name] isn't real. It's [what you actually made]. [Proof of realism].`

---

### Formula 4: "WHAT IF" (Possibility Opening)
**Pattern:** Pose hypothetical → show you already did it

**Examples:**
- "What if your dream outdoor brand didn't need months of product sampling, campaign planning, or expensive shoots?"
- "What if I could build a whole bar in ChatGPT instead?"
- "What if a run club looked more like a fashion label?"

**Why it works:**
- Opens imagination before showing solution
- Frames old way as unnecessary
- Positions AI as liberation from constraints

**Template:** `What if [painful traditional process] wasn't necessary? [Show that it isn't]`

---

### Formula 5: "ONE PROMPT" (Simplicity Promise)
**Pattern:** Reduce complex output to single input

**Examples:**
- "One master prompt = studio level photography"
- "All of these images were created using one exact AI prompt"
- "Every frame in this video was generated with AI, from gritty close-ups to wide-angle campaign visuals"
- "Using just one singular Alpha Prompt as the foundation"

**Why it works:**
- Radical simplification is inherently shareable
- Implies anyone can do it
- Creates desire for "the one prompt"

**Template:** `All of this was created with [one thing]. Comment [word] to get it.`

---

### Formula 6: "AT FIRST GLANCE" (Perception Challenge)
**Pattern:** Set up expectation → subvert it

**Examples:**
- "At first glance, this could be a high-budget beauty campaign: gleaming sunglasses, clinical lighting..."
- "These portraits weren't captured in a studio. They were designed using AI"
- "These images weren't shot on a street corner - they were prompted"

**Why it works:**
- Makes viewer question their perception
- Elevates the AI output to professional level
- Creates "how did they do that" curiosity

**Template:** `At first glance, this looks like [expensive thing]. But [reveal the simple truth].`

---

## POSTING PATTERNS

### Cross-Platform Strategy:
- Same content posted to both IG and TikTok
- Captions nearly identical
- TikTok typically gets higher view counts
- IG gets higher comment rates (likely due to comment-trigger CTAs)

### Content Velocity:
- ~2-4 posts per week on TikTok
- Similar frequency on Instagram
- Major viral hits cluster around brand build content

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR REPLICATION

### 1. Lead with Completed Projects
Don't say "AI can make brands" - say "I built this brand in a weekend"

### 2. Name Everything
"Smash Burger," "Montée," "Made for Monty" - fake brands feel real when named

### 3. Emphasize What's NOT Needed
"No camera, no studio, no model, no team" - liberation narrative

### 4. Build Systems, Not One-Offs
"It's not random, it's a system" - position yourself as systematic thinker

### 5. Use Single-Word Comment Triggers
"Skin," "vision," "Cafe" - low friction, high conversion

### 6. Acknowledge Past Failures
"After countless failed attempts..." / "This is where AI used to fail..." - validation

### 7. Show the Texture
Close-ups, grain, imperfection, material detail - proves quality

### 8. Cross-Post Identical Content
Same video, same caption, different platforms - maximize reach
