## DM TEMPLATES BY LEAD MAGNET

### Template: VISION (5-Layer Prompting)
```
🎁 Here's your 5-Layer Prompting Guide:

[LINK]

This is the exact framework I use to create images that don't look like "AI slop."

Most people only use 1-2 layers. That's why their results look flat.

Save this and try Layer 4 first — that's where the magic happens.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: PROMPT (A.R.T.S. Framework)
```
🎁 Here's your A.R.T.S. Prompt Framework:

[LINK]

A = Atmosphere
R = Reference
T = Technique
S = Specificity

This is how you go from "generic AI" to "wait, is that real?"

Try it on your next image and tag me in the results.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: CAFE (Brand Book)
```
🎁 Here's your Café Brand Asset Pack:

[LINK]

Inside: 10 prompts + style settings + the exact workflow to build a complete brand identity in one afternoon.

Most people think you need weeks. You don't.

Let me know what café name you come up with 👀

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: SREF (Style Codes)
```
🎁 Here's your 15 Midjourney SREF Codes:

[LINK]

These are hand-curated. Not random codes I found online.

Each one has a specific vibe:
• Editorial minimalism
• 90s film photography
• Luxury product shots
• And 12 more...

Try --sref [code] at the end of your next prompt.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: MONEY (Client Acquisition)
```
🎁 Here's your Client Acquisition Guide:

[LINK]

The 3 places I find AI image clients:
1. Agency Slack groups
2. LinkedIn (yes, really)
3. Upwork (specific strategy inside)

Plus: exact pricing and how to pitch.

This took me 6 months to figure out. You get it in 5 pages.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: HOTEL (50 Prompts)
```
🎁 Here's your Hotel Brand Asset Pack:

[LINK]

50 prompts organized by:
• Room interiors
• Exteriors
• Food & dining
• Lifestyle moments
• Detail shots

Use these as templates. Swap the hotel name and style.

Most brands pay $10K+ for this type of asset library.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: INCOME (Revenue Guide)
```
🎁 Here's your 5 Revenue Streams Guide:

[LINK]

How I'm monetizing AI images:
1. Client work ($500-5K/project)
2. Stock submissions ($50-200/month passive)
3. Brand asset packs ($47-197 each)
4. 1:1 coaching ($200/hr)
5. Course sales (building now)

Pick ONE. Master it. Then add the next.

— LoopWorker
```

### Template: FASHION (Prompt Pack)
```
🎁 Here's your 25 Fashion Prompts:

[LINK]

From editorial to streetwear to luxury — all the looks, all the vibes.

Each prompt includes:
• Camera angle
• Lighting setup
• Mood/atmosphere
• Styling details

These are ready to use. No tweaking required.

## AUTOMATION RULES

### Comment Detection Settings
- **Exact match:** OFF (allows "VISION please" to trigger)
- **Case sensitive:** OFF
- **Include replies:** ON
- **Exclude own comments:** ON

### Rate Limiting
- **Same user cooldown:** 24 hours (prevents spam triggers)

## TRACKING & ANALYTICS

### Tags to Create
For each trigger, create a tag:
- `lead_magnet_vision`
- `lead_magnet_prompt`
- `lead_magnet_cafe`
- etc.

### Custom Fields
- `first_trigger_date` — When they first engaged
- `total_triggers` — How many lead magnets they've claimed
- `highest_value_trigger` — CLIENT, MONEY, INCOME = high intent

### Segments to Build
1. **New Leads** — Triggered in last 7 days
2. **Engaged** — Triggered 3+ times
3. **High Intent** — Triggered MONEY, CLIENT, or INCOME
4. **Cold** — No trigger in 30+ days
